# Navigating to Semantics: Advancing Generative AI in Financial Text Analysis

This repository houses the implementation and findings of my Master's thesis titled "Navigating to Semantics: Advancing Generative AI using Prompt and Data Management Strategies." The goal of this project is to enhance the capabilities of generative AI models, specifically BERT, FinBERT, and RoBERTa, in interpreting and analyzing financial texts. This involves extracting financial texts based on specific keywords from bank financial reports and employing a series of advanced analytical techniques to uncover deeper semantic insights.

## Overview

The financial sector generates vast amounts of textual data, necessitating sophisticated tools for analysis. Traditional methods often fall short in handling the complexity and volume of this data. This thesis aims to address this gap by leveraging the latest advancements in generative AI for financial text analysis. The research focuses on optimizing the performance of AI models in semantic similarity analysis, clustering, information retrieval, and hypernym identification, aiming to contribute to the field of generative AI and financial analysis.
