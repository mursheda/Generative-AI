Siemens Bank 2022,Prof- itability of the portfolio which is reflected in a significant  increase in net interest income also exceeds expectations  overall,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2022,The significant increase in additions to provisions for  losses on loans and advances is primarily due to the provi- sioning for an exposure in the European energy infrastruc- ture sector which has been adversely affected by the Ukraine  conflict,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,As a result profit from operations is significantly below  Siemens Banks planning primarily due to the aforemen- tioned provisioning,PROFIT
Siemens Bank 2022,In the deposit and treasury business the Group financ- ing portfolio which forms an integral part of the loans and  advances to customers fell to 76 million previous year  116 million,DEPOSIT
Siemens Bank 2022,The provision of collateral in cash means that  Siemens Bank does not bear any credit risk in connection  with this business,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2022,Within the deposit and treasury business the development  of liquidity-related investments  which are reported under  loans and advances to banks credit balances with central  banks private bonds as well as under loans and advances to  customers  is closely linked to the economic and regulatory  requirements relating to liquidity control,INVESTMENT

Siemens Bank 2022,Although by far the largest proportion of deposits is made  by Siemens AG and its subsidiaries Siemens Bank also holds  deposits of customers from outside the Group,DEPOSIT
Siemens Bank 2022,However  Siemens Bank does not accept retail banking deposits,DEPOSIT
Siemens Bank 2022,Where  deposits are used directly for the purpose of funding the len- ding business they are matched as far as possible with the  lending currencies in accordance with the expected repay - ment profiles so that the exposure of Siemens Bank to cur - rency and maturity transformation risk is limited,DEPOSIT
Siemens Bank 2022,Currently Siemens Bank has not issued any bonds on capital  markets nor has it placed any promissory note loans or other  bonds,BONDS
Siemens Bank 2022,Furthermore Siemens Bank has not made any substantial  capital investments or financial investments in the 2022   fiscal year,INVESTMENT
Siemens Bank 2022,Results of operations The 2022 fiscal year saw strong operational performance with  an increase in the lending portfolio and higher interest mar - gins which is reflected in significantly improved net inter - est income after the moderate growth of the previous year,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2022,Nevertheless additions to allowances for losses on loans and  advances were significantly higher than in the previous year  due primarily to provisioning for an exposure in the European  energy infrastructure sector that was adversely affected by  the Ukraine conflict,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,As a result Siemens Bank was not able to match the positive  development of the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years but achieved  by far the highest operating income before allowances for  losses on loans and advances since the Banks formation  despite the challenging developments in connection with   the Ukraine crisis,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,Interest terms also reflect the effect of inflation,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2022,The  net interest margin contribution from the lending business  generates most of the net interest income,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2022,Liquidity-related  investments in the deposit and treasury business normally  generate lower interest margins,INVESTMENT
Siemens Bank 2022,As the portfolio in the core  lending business grew strongly in the 2022 fiscal year after  moderate growth in the previous year the increase in net  interest income reflects the increased average portfolio vol- ume,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2022,Nominal net interest income is also heavily dependent  on the volatility of exchange rates during the year as a signif- icant portion of the portfolio is denominated in USD GBP and  AUD,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2022,Since growth in the lending  business portfolio in the 2022 fiscal year was stronger than  in previous years and net interest margins were success- fully increased the increase in net interest income exceeds  Siemens Banks expectations,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2022,The relative increase in general admin- istration expenses in the past fiscal year was below the rela- tive increase in net interest income and thus in line with the  Banks expectations,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2022,As in the previous year the increase  is primarily due to higher personnel expenses significant- ly increased regulatory costs and upfront expenses for the  development of EPT as a new business segment,REGULATORY
Siemens Bank 2022,The impact of  currency effects on the Banks profitability is limited espe- cially due to the funding of loans in foreign currencies in the  same currency,PROFIT
Siemens Bank 2022,Expenses for additions to allowances for losses on loans  and advances increased significantly in the 2022 fiscal year  compared to the previous year and were thus higher than  expected by Siemens Bank at the beginning of the fiscal year,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,In general the structure  of the lending portfolio  a high proportion of project financ- ing in the infrastructure sector and of corporate lending  transactions with equity sponsors from the private equity   sector  predominantly proved to be resilient to credit  defaults also during the Ukraine crisis and against the back - ground of increased macroeconomic uncertainties,EQUITY
Siemens Bank 2022,This effect dominates the item allowances  for losses on loans and advances and is primarily responsible  for the increase compared to previous years,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,Overall the con- tinued good credit quality of the receivables portfolio and the  broad diversification by sector and region also contributed to  the fact that the balance sheet allowances for losses on loans  and advances for large parts of the lending portfolio contin- ued to be very moderate overall in the 2022 fiscal year,LOSS

Siemens Bank 2022,Against the backdrop of market movements in the interest   rate FX and refinancing environment the Management  Board takes a critical view of the risk development is how - ever satisfied overall with the development of internal capital  adequacy in the past fiscal year,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2022,In particular the risk capital  requirement for credit risk increased at a slightly slower pace  than growth in the lending portfolio and the other impacts  from geopolitical changes supply chain disruptions and mar - ket price fluctuations on internal capital adequacy remain  manageable,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2022,The risk-taking potential in a stress scenario results from the  risk-taking potential less additional losses in the stress sce- nario,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,Starting with the 20212022 fiscal year prepay - ment risk is no longer considered within the internal capital  adequacy as in total economic losses due to the early   termination of loan agreements no longer occur and the   early termination of refinancing agreements is no longer   necessary due to improved operational management,LOSS

Siemens Bank 2022,The credit value at risk serves to quantify an unex- pected loss and is a key risk variable in portfolio modeling,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,Credit  risk modeling at the portfolio level uses a simulation-based  asset-value model,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2022,Custom- ers with similar economic characteristics are aggregated into  risk units in order to calculate the unexpected loss,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,A loss distribu- tion for the lending portfolio is generated from the result- ing changes in the probability of default,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,In addition to the  correlations of the risk units another key input variable for  the Monte Carlo simulation is the probability of a credit rat- ing migration,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2022,To obtain this data the Bank draws up a table  based on historical credit rating migrations,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2022,The simulated loss distribution takes into account  not only losses due to a migration to a default class but also  economic losses by a risk unit caused as a result of the deteri- oration in credit rating,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,The exposure for a risk unit comprises  the loan amount paid out and any weighted amount related  to open external credit lines,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2022,In addition to losses due to rat- ing migration the portfolio model also takes into consider - ation fluctuations of the recovery rate and asset recoveries,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,While negative recovery fluctuations lead to higher loss in the  event of rating migration asset recovery fluctuations lead to  direct loss in market value,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,For customers with specific loan  loss provisions the exposure is reduced by the value of the  specific loan loss provision,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,The credit value at risk and the  risk contributions for the risk units are then derived from the  loss distribution,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,In addition to the credit value at risk the  risk contributions from the largest portfolios and segments  are also calculated in order to measure concentration risk,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2022,Country risk Country risk is measured by analyzing concentration risk for  individual countries in terms of economic capital require- ment and credit exposure,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2022,Country risk is limited both by  preventive action in which exposure limits must be adhered  to during the course of the credit process and by the ongoing  analysis of concentration risk in individual countries,CREDIT

Siemens Bank 2022,Stress tests  on the other hand provide a holistic view for the purpos- es of assessing credit risk,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2022,The bor - rowers credit rating itself is determined independently of any  individual transactions and as a result also independently  of available collateral,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2022,Types of collateral In its management of credit risk Siemens Bank makes a   distinction between two fundamental categories of collateral  The first category comprises assets in the form of financial  or other collateral that the Bank can realize in the event of  a default thereby allowing the Bank to limit the incurred  loss,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,This category includes in particular physical assets in  the case of capital investment loans or project finance as  well as cash collateral,INVESTMENT
Siemens Bank 2022,The second category comprises collateral in the form of  guarantees furnished not by the borrower but by indepen- dent third parties for example government export credit  insurance,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2022,Collateral management Both categories of collateral form an integral part of credit  risk management at Siemens Bank provided that such col- lateral meets internal requirements for collateral that can be  accepted by the Bank,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2022,Specifically collateral in the second  category is only acceptable if the credit rating of the guar - antor is better than the rating of the original borrower the  guarantee is directly legally enforceable all documentary  requirements are met and the guarantor is not an individual,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2022,Collateral in the first category results in a reduction in the  expected and in the unexpected loss because the recovery  rate for the transaction has been increased or because an  asset recovery is recognized,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,Collateral in the second catego- ry also leads to a reduction in the expected and unexpected  loss in that the credit rating of the guarantor is also factored  into the calculation,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,These  allowances are intended to cover the expected loss after tak - ing into account any expected proceeds from the realized col- lateral,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,Siemens Bank also recognizes general loan loss provi- sions to cover the latent credit risk in the portfolio of loans  and advances,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,In doing so loan loss provision rates based on  the rating the expected term and the internal estimate of  loss ratios in the event of loss are applied to the unsecured  exposure,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,The rating also factors in an assessment of country  risk with the result that any general loan loss provision rec- ognized by the Bank also covers the assumed latent country  risk,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,As of September 30 2022 Siemens Bank had total recog- nized specific and general loan loss provisions of 161,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,Specific loan loss provi- sions include transaction-specific assessments of future cash  flows probabilities of default and expected loss rates tak - ing into account collateral and where applicable restructur - ing effects,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,This effect dominates  the item allowances for losses on loans and advances and  is primarily responsible for the increase compared to previ- ous years,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,The provisions for latent credit risks increased only  slightly as significant additions were already made in the  previous fiscal year,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2022,The amount of capital required is largely determined by the  lending portfolio volume borrower credit ratings collater - alization and borrower industrial sectors and countries,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2022,The  year-on-year increase in required risk capital is mainly due to  increased credit exposure and the deteriorating credit envi- ronment in the second half of the year,CREDIT

Siemens Bank 2022,Within strict limits deposits are also used for funding the  lending business,DEPOSIT
Siemens Bank 2022,Currently market risk at Siemens Bank  comprises interest-rate risk and currency risk,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2022,Market liquidity risk is managed in an integrated approach  in conjunction with the management of market risk because  Siemens Bank is only exposed to market liquidity risk as a  result of ordinary interest-rate and currency derivatives that it  enters into to reduce the risk arising from open risk positions,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2022,Siemens Bank takes on  market risk positions solely in the context of its asset-liability  management,LIABILITY
Siemens Bank 2022,In addition to measuring present value market risk Siemens   Bank also calculates a monthly value-at-risk to measure net  interest income NII in accordance with the European Bank - ing Authority EBA guidelines for managing interest rate risk  in the banking book IRRBB,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2022,The  main part of this originates from the changes in the interest  rate market and the increased interest rates in EUR GBP and  USD,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2022,Any losses actually incurred above a defined threshold value  are recorded without delay in the Banks own database of  losses and analyzed to establish the cause of the losses,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2022,Siemens Bank uses the basic indicator approach BIA as spec- ified in CRR II in order to measure and cover the regulatory  capital requirement for operational risk,REGULATORY
