Helaba Bank,Due to the noticeable rise  in interest rates and wider credit spreads remeasurement gains  on derivatives within net x-value adjustments  XVA s and a clear  increase in customer demand for hedging instruments and cap - ital market finance were the main drivers of the positive trend  in net trading income,INTEREST
Helaba Bank,This very significant im- provement is explained in part by lower expenses from interest  on pension and other provisions and in part by the fact that the  prior-year figure was adversely affected by additions to provi- sions,INTEREST
Helaba Bank,Other administrative expenses were  impacted by a very sharp increase in the European bank levy of   20 m to  90 m and a very strong rise in expenses for the asso- ciation overhead allocation and the reserve funds of  35 m to   81 m,FUNDS
