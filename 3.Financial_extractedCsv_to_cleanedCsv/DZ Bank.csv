DZ Bank,The fair values of bonds without liquid markets that are reported within financial assets held for trading  investments and loans and advanc es to customers were given an individual adjustment spread or were  measured using Bloomberg Valuation Service prices which are observable in the market,INVESTMENT
DZ Bank,All other things  being equal an increase in the pertinent measurement assumptions of 1  percent would have led to the  recognition of a 14  million loss in the income statement and a loss of 3  million under other comprehensive  incomeloss,LOSS
DZ Bank,An alternative assumption about the credit spreads used could have led to a significant change in the fair  values of some of the ABSs reported under financial assets held for trading and under investments,INVESTMENT
DZ Bank,All other  138  DZ BA NK   2023 Half -Year Financial Report   Interim consolidated financial statements   Notes      things being equal an increase of 1  percent in these spreads would have led to the recognition of a 1  million  loss under other comprehensive incomeloss,LOSS

DZ Bank,The impairment rules are also applied to    financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments that fall within the scope of IFRS  9 and are not  recognized at fair value through profit or loss    lease receivables and    trade receivables and contract assets pursuant to IFRS  15,PROFIT
DZ Bank,In accordance with IFRS 9  the three -stage approach is used additionally taking POCI assets into account to  determine the expected losses    Stage 1 For financial assets whose credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition that  were not credit -impaired upon  initial recognition the 12 -month credit loss is recognized,LOSS
DZ Bank,Interest is  recognized on the basis of the gross carrying amount,INTEREST
DZ Bank,Stage 2 For financial assets whose credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition but are not  considered cre dit-impaired the loss allowances are determined in the amount of the assets lifetime  expected credit losses,LOSS
DZ Bank,Interest is recognized on the basis of the gross carrying amount,INTEREST

DZ Bank,For the  140  DZ BA NK   2023 Half -Year Financial Report   Interim consolidated financial statements   Notes      quantitative transfer criterion the credit risk as at the balance sheet date for the residual life is compared with  the assets credit risk over the same maturity period esti mated at the time of initial recognition,CREDIT
DZ Bank,The thresholds  that indicate a significant increase in credit risk are determined for each portfolio separately as the ratio of the  latest changes in the lifetime probability of default lifetime PD to the portfol ios past lifetime PD,CREDIT
DZ Bank,Internal risk  measurement systems external credit ratings and risk forecasts are also used to assess the credit risk of  financial assets,CREDIT
DZ Bank,These also have significa ntly increased credit risk and are assigned  to stage 2 unless they need to be assigned to stage 3,CREDIT
DZ Bank,Assets with low credit risk andor an investment -grade credit rating are also monitored for increases in credit risk  and for credit rating changes,INVESTMENT
DZ Bank,If the quantitative transfer thresh old is exceeded however the low credit risk  exemption means that these assets are transferred to stage 2 only if a qualitative transfer criterion applies or if a  non-investment -grade credit rating is awarded,INVESTMENT

DZ Bank,If on the balance sheet date it is found that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk compared  with previous balance sheet dates the financial assets in qu estion are transferred back to stage 1 and the loss  allowances are brought back down to the level of the 12 -month expected credit loss,LOSS
DZ Bank,If a financial instrument  in stage 3 recovers the difference between the interest income determined for the period of c redit  impairment on the basis of amortized cost and the actual interest income recognized in respect of the  financial instrument for the period concerned is reported as a reversal of an impairment loss or a reversal of  loss allowances,LOSS

DZ Bank,It is also evident that the effects of group contagion in the definition of default have an only  immaterial impact on credit risk,CREDIT
DZ Bank,Overall the updating of the post -model adjustments resulted in a reduction in loss allowances of  33 million recognized in profit or loss and thus taking account of portfolio growth and an increase in risk  totaling 5  million led to a post -model adjustment of 39  million as at June 30 2023,PROFIT
DZ Bank,Impact of macroeconomic conditions   The established models and processes for calculating expected losses on specific exposures or at portfolio level in  line with IFRS  9 have generally been retained,LOSS
DZ Bank,These effects are factored into the calculation of specific  loan loss allowances and in a more nuanced manner in the credit assessment and in decisions concerning  inclusion in watchlists for the early identif ication of risk,LOSS
DZ Bank,At portfolio level the forecast macroeconomic  conditions are taken into account by adjusting the model -driven default probability profiles used in economic  and regulatory risk management on the basis of shift factors,REGULATORY
