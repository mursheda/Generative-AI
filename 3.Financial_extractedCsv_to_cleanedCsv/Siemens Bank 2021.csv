Siemens Bank 2021,The economic environment this year continued to be  characterized by extensive monetary and fiscal policy mea- sures in the industrialized countries as well as a persistently  loose monetary policy of important central banks and a very  low interest rate level despite a noticeably higher inflation  trend,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2021,In the financing of projects and equipment investments for  which longer-term and therefore less cyclical planning cycles  are regularly relevant and also in project financing in the  infrastructure sector which has proven to be quite resilient to  credit defaults even in the environment of the COVID-19 pan- demic Siemens Bank continues to observe ongoing intense  competition in the search for attractive risk-return profiles as  interest rate levels remain historically low especially in the  eurozone,INVESTMENT
Siemens Bank 2021,Furthermore new competitors beyond traditional  banks such as insurance companies pension funds or alter - native investment funds continue to increase liquidity in the  market with their demand for project financing and corpo- rate loans intensifying pressure on margins and documenta- tion standards,INVESTMENT
Siemens Bank 2021,In particular due to the increased importance  of the topic of sustainability there is growing demand for  financing with a positive assessment under the ESG criteria  ESG Environmental Social Governance which will put fur - ther pressure on interest margins,INTEREST

Siemens Bank 2021,Although by far the largest proportion of deposits is made  by Siemens AG and its subsidiaries Siemens Bank also holds  deposits of customers from outside the Group,DEPOSIT
Siemens Bank 2021,However  Siemens Bank does not accept retail banking deposits,DEPOSIT
Siemens Bank 2021,Where  deposits are used directly for the purpose of funding the  lending business they are matched as far as possible with  the lending currencies in accordance with the expected  repayment profiles so that the exposure of Siemens Bank to  currency and maturity transformation risk is very limited,DEPOSIT
Siemens Bank 2021,Currently Siemens Bank has not issued any bonds on capital  markets nor has it placed any promissory note loans or other  bonds,BONDS
Siemens Bank 2021,Furthermore Siemens Bank has not made any substantial  capital investments or financial investments in the 2021 fiscal  year,INVESTMENT
Siemens Bank 2021,Results of operations On the one hand the 2021 fiscal year was characterized by a  moderately increased lending portfolio which is reflected in  improved net interest income after the marginal growth of  the previous year,INTEREST

Siemens Bank 2021,Liquidity-related invest- ments in the deposit and treasury business normally gener - ate lower interest margins,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2021,As the portfolio in the core lend- ing business grew moderately in the 2021 fiscal year after  remaining almost constant in the previous year the increase  in net interest income reflects the increased average portfolio  volume,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2021,Nominal net interest income is also heavily depen- dent on the volatility of exchange rates during the year as  a significant portion of the portfolio is denominated in USD  GBP and AUD,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2021,Overall Siemens Bank  was able to continue to generate attractive risk-return pro- files in the lending business as also against the background  of a persistently low interest level in important core markets  new loan transactions were only entered into selectively and  the pursued business strategy was not purely volume-driven,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2021,Since the portfolio in the lending business grew moderately  in the 2021 fiscal year and net interest margins were suc- cessfully kept largely stable in spite of the high competitive  pressure in the lending markets the increase in net interest  income is in line with Siemens Banks expectations,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2021,The  relative increase in general administrative expenses in the  past fiscal year was slightly above the relative increase in net  interest income and thus slightly above the Banks expec- tations,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2021,The increase is due in particular to higher person- nel expenses significantly increased regulatory costs and  upfront expenses for the development of a new business  field,REGULATORY
Siemens Bank 2021,The impact of curren- cy effects on the Banks profitability is in particular limited  through the funding of loans in foreign currencies in the  same currency,PROFIT

Siemens Bank 2021,The credit value at risk serves to quantify an unex- pected loss and is a key risk variable in portfolio modeling,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,Credit risk  modeling at the portfolio level uses a simulation-based asset- value model,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2021,Customers with  similar economic characteristics are aggregated into risk units  in order to calculate the unexpected loss,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,A loss distribution for  the lending portfolio is generated from the resulting changes  in the probability of default,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,In addition to the correlations of  the risk units another key input variable for the Monte Carlo  simulation is the probability of a credit rating migration,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2021,To  obtain this data the Bank draws up a table based on histori- cal credit rating migrations,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2021,The simu- lated loss distribution takes into account not only losses due  to a migration to a default class but also economic losses by  a risk unit caused as a result of the deterioration in credit rat- ing,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,The exposure for a risk unit comprises the loan amount  paid out and any weighted amount related to open external  credit lines,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2021,In addition to losses due to rating migration the portfolio model also takes into consideration fluctuations  of the recovery rate and asset recoveries,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,While negative  recovery fluctuations lead to higher loss in the event of rat- ing migration asset recovery fluctuations lead to direct loss  in market value,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,For customers with specific loan loss provi- sions the exposure is reduced by the value of the specific  loan loss provision,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,The credit value at risk and the risk contri- butions for the risk units are then derived from the loss distri- bution,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,In addition to the credit value at risk the risk con- tributions from the largest portfolios and segments are also  calculated in order to measure concentration risk,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2021,Country risk Country risk is measured by analyzing concentration risk for  individual countries in terms of economic capital require- ment and credit exposure,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2021,Country risk is limited both by  preventive action in which exposure limits must be adhered  to during the course of the credit process and by the ongoing  analysis of concentration risk in individual countries,CREDIT

Siemens Bank 2021,The stress tests and sensitivity analyses for  credit risk are carried out regularly for the overall risk report- ing as well as ad hoc,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2021,Stress tests  on the other hand provide a holistic view for the purpos- es of assessing credit risk,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2021,The bor - rowers credit rating itself is determined independently of any  individual transactions and as a result also independently  of available collateral,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2021,Types of collateral In its management of credit risk Siemens Bank makes a dis- tinction between two fundamental categories of collateral  The first category comprises assets in the form of financial  or other collateral that the Bank can realize in the event of  a default thereby allowing the Bank to limit the incurred  loss,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,This category includes in particular physical assets in  the case of capital investment loans or project finance as  well as cash collateral,INVESTMENT
Siemens Bank 2021,The second category comprises collateral in the form of  guarantees furnished not by the borrower but by indepen- dent third parties for example government export credit  insurance,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2021,Collateral management Both categories of collateral form an integral part of credit  risk management at Siemens Bank provided that such col- lateral meets internal requirements for collateral that can be  accepted by the Bank,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2021,Specifically collateral in the second  category is only acceptable if the credit rating of the guar - antor is better than the rating of the original borrower the  guarantee is directly legally enforceable all documentary  requirements are met and the guarantor is not an individual,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2021,Collateral in the first category results in a reduction in the  expected and in the unexpected loss because the recovery  rate for the transaction has been increased or because an  asset recovery has been claimed,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,Collateral in the second  category also leads to a reduction in the expected and unex- pected loss in that the credit rating of the guarantor is also  factored into the calculation,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,These  allowances are intended to cover the expected loss after tak - ing into account any expected proceeds from the realized col- lateral,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,Siemens Bank also recognizes general loan loss provi- sions to cover the latent credit risk in the portfolio of loans  and advances,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,In doing so loan loss provision rates based on  the rating the expected term and the internal estimate of  loss ratios in the event of loss are applied to the unsecured  exposure,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,The rating also factors in an assessment of country  risk with the result that any general loan loss provision rec- ognized by the Bank also covers the assumed latent country  risk,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,As of September 30 2021 Siemens Bank had total recognized  specific and general loan loss provisions of 76,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,The increase before provisions for  general banking risks results mainly from higher specific loan  loss provisions,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,Specific loan loss provisions include trans- action-specific assessments of future cash flows probabili- ties of default and expected loss rates taking into account  collateral and where applicable restructuring effects,LOSS
Siemens Bank 2021,The  increased provisions for latent credit risks are attributable  to the riskier market environment and changes in the rating  structure of the portfolio,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2021,The amount of capital required is largely determined by the  lending portfolio volume borrower credit ratings collater - alization and borrower industrial sectors and countries,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2021,The  year-on-year increase in required risk capital is mainly due to  increased credit exposure,CREDIT

Siemens Bank 2021,Prepayment risk Prepayment risk is the risk that as a result of a prema- ture repayment of a variable interest loan by the borrower  Siemens Bank must then pay prepayment compensation  on the corresponding funding when it is terminated early,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2021,Because the loans are variable interest loans only the chang- es in the funding spreads are relevant for the prepayment  compensation calculation,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2021,For loans with fixed interest rates  market value compensation clauses are agreed upon,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2021,Pre- payment risk arises therefore due to overestimation of the  expected maturity of the credit business,CREDIT
Siemens Bank 2021,Siemens   Bank takes on funding positions that result in liquidity risk  only within the framework of its asset-liability management,LIABILITY
Siemens Bank 2021,These optional and  modeled cash flows include for example outstanding proj- ect finance drawings committed but undrawn lines of credit  the notified lending and deposit business possible drawings  from the guarantee exposure as well as possible and immi- nent losses in the lending portfolio,LOSS

Siemens Bank 2021,Currently market risk at Siemens Bank  comprises interest-rate risk and currency risk,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2021,Market liquidity risk is managed in an integrated approach  in conjunction with the management of market risk because  Siemens Bank is only exposed to market liquidity risk as a  result of ordinary interest-rate and currency derivatives that it  enters into to reduce the risk arising from open risk positions,INTEREST
Siemens Bank 2021,Siemens Bank takes on  market risk positions solely in the context of its asset-liability  management,LIABILITY
Siemens Bank 2021,These activities include both the monitoring of compliance  with operational limits and an analysis of the financial profit- and-loss account on a daily basis,PROFIT
Siemens Bank 2021,In addition to measuring present value market risk Siemens   Bank also calculates a monthly value-at-risk to measure net  interest income NII in accordance with the European Bank - ing Authority EBA guidelines for managing interest rate risk  in the banking book IRRBB,INTEREST
