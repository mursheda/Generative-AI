Commerz Bank,Financial Statements and Management Report 2022 29  The sharp rise in interest rates has led to a marked decline in  new mortgage business both in Germany and in many other eurozone countries even though mortgage volumes as a whole  have continued to grow,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,Noticeable declines were recorded above  all for loans with long fixed-interest periods of at least ten years,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,At the same time  however margins on deposits are improving as a result of the  general rise in interest rates which may well more than offset the negative effect mentioned above,INTEREST

Commerz Bank,The outlook with regard to banks interest margins has  brightened,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,For a long time persis tently low interest rates were  considered one of the key challenges,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,Central banks reacted to the  far-reaching economic impact of the pandemic with bond  purchase programmes extensive liquidity provision and a zero interest rate policy,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,Government  lending programmes also had a  negative impact on banks interest margins and profitability,PROFIT
Commerz Bank,Achievable net interest margins were therefore very low throughout Europe but particularly in the German banking  market,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,At the same time refinanc ing costs rose due to the growth  in customer deposits,DEPOSIT
Commerz Bank,A marked increase in  credit interest rates including in Germany is enabling banks to improve their interest margins and thus also boosting the income  trend across the entire financial sector,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,In addition the fierce national competition among German banks means that earnings potential  in retail banking remains limited even with improved interest  margins especially as deposit rates are also likely to rise further over time,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,As in the dominant interest-bearing business the prospects in  trading business can currently be regarded as positive as a result of the volatile market environment,INTEREST

Commerz Bank,With  a clear focus on profitable customer business the speed of  transformation is to be mainta ined unabated,PROFIT
Commerz Bank,A mild re cession with continued high  inflation and associated higher interest rates has a material impact on the expected financial results for 2023,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,Anticipated performance of indi vidual earnings components  Higher interest rates already had a positive impact on net interest income in 2022,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,For 2023 we expect  a further slight increase in  net interest income to  over 6,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,In the event that the higher  forward interest rates from January 2023 are realised on the  market and the interest pass-through on deposit balances remains  five percentage poin ts below the expected 30 net interest  income is expected to total 7,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,The driver for this increase is  wider margins in customer deposits,DEPOSIT
Commerz Bank,In particular non-interest- bearing demand deposits from customers can be invested at higher interest rates th an in the past,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,In 2023 this will more than  offset the loss of 189m in extraordinary income received in 2022  from longer-term refinancing operations with the ECB TLTRO,LOSS
Commerz Bank,mBank in Poland contributed in  particular to the increase in net interest income for the Group last  year,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,However the Bank expects the trend to be largely flat in 2023 reflecting an increased pass-through of interest rates to  mBank customers,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,Net income from financial assets and liabilities measured at fair  value through profit or loss is generally subject to increased  volatility which can be influenced only to a limited extent,PROFIT
Commerz Bank,Sometimes they ma y require similar items to be  presented as fair value measurements in the fair value result in  one time period whereas the interest component dominates in another,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,Year-on-year shifts betw een the income items net interest  income and fair value result  and vice versa  are therefore  possible,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,A portion of this income component is therefore directly related to net interest income,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,Experience has shown that the other income items including  realised profit or losses on financial instruments and other net  income are often affected to a large extent by one-off income and measurement effects that are usually impossible to predict,PROFIT
Commerz Bank,This means that operating expenses reflect any deviations from budgeted income and for  example determine whether funds for investment are released or  withheld,INVESTMENT
Commerz Bank,Overall in addition to operating profit the consolidated profit  attributable to Commerzbank shareholders and investors in additional equity components is also expected to increase  significantly in 2023,PROFIT
Commerz Bank,At the same  time further investments will be made in digital applications and processes,INVESTMENT
Commerz Bank,Net interest income should increa se due to the rise in interest  rates in the current year when the prior-year figure is adjusted for the Group-neutral extraordinary income from fair value  adjustments of around 90m in  the second quarter of 2022,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,The reason for this forecast is the expectation of largely unchanged equity indices particularly in  Germany,EQUITY
Commerz Bank,Overall we expect net income in the PSBC segment to be  significantly higher than in the previous year on the assumption  that the high one-time charges at  mBank in Poland resulting from  the credit holidays and from provisions for legal risks in connection with mortgage loans issued in foreign currencies will  not recur in the current year,CREDIT
Commerz Bank,Despite expecting a higher charge  f o r  t h e  r i s k  r e s u l t  i n  t h e   PSBC segment than in the previous year we expect operating  profit to increase year on year due to rising income,PROFIT
Commerz Bank,As such the  operating return on equity should increase significantly and the cost-income ratio in the PSBC segment should fall,EQUITY
Commerz Bank,Commerzbank is expecting a further significant increase in net  interest income in the CC segment due to higher market interest  rates which allow corporate client deposits to be reinvested at higher margins than in the past,INTEREST
Commerz Bank,In summary without the additi onal potential from higher  forward interest rates materialising we are expecting a slightly higher operating profit  for the Corporate Clients segment in 2023,PROFIT
Commerz Bank,The operating return on equity should therefore remain stable with  slightly higher risk-weighted assets  while there is likely to be a  slight improvement in the cost-income ratio,EQUITY
