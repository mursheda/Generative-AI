Norddeutsche Bank,In our vie w the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows    Determination of specific loan loss allowances in the commercial customer lending business    Determination of general loan loss provisions in the customer lending business    Subsequent val uation of the guarantees agreed with the State of Lower Saxony    Loss -free valuation of interest -bearing transactions in the banking book   Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows    Matter and issue    Audit approach and findings    Reference to further information   Hereinafter we present the key audit matters    Determination of specific loan loss allowances in the commercial customer lending business    In the Companys annual financial statements loans receiv ables amounting to  66,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,As of the  balance sheet date there is a risk provision for losses on loans and advances in the form of specific  loan lo ss allowances among other things which are largely determined by the commercial customer  lending business,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,The measurement of the allowance for losses on loans and advances in the commer- cial customer lending business is determined in particular by the st ructure and quality of the loan  portfolios macroeconomic factors and the estimates of the legal representatives with regard to future  cash flows among other things against the background of the expected impact of the current macroe- conomic conditions on the commercial customer lending business,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,The amount of specific loan loss  allowances for commercial customer loans is the difference between the outstanding loan amount  and the lower value to be attributed to it at the reporting date,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,The allowance for losses on loans and advances to commercial customers is measured on the basis of  probability -weighted scenarios which also take into account the impact of macroeconomic factors on  cash flows,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,In addition the amount of the allowances  for impairment losses in the commercial customer lending business is highly significant for the net  assets and the financial performance of the Company,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,In addition we assessed the valuatio n of commercial customer loans including the appropri- ateness of estimated values on the basis of samples of credit exposures,CREDIT
Norddeutsche Bank,Furthermore in order to assess the spe- cific loan loss allowances made we evaluated the calculation models used by the Company and the  underlying assu mptions and parameters,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,The Companys disclosures on the allowance for losses on loans and advances to customers are in- cluded in the section Accounting policies - non -trading portfolio banking book of the notes to the  financial statements    Determination of general loan loss provisions in the customer lending business    General loan loss provisions are recognized for counterparty risks in the customer lending business  that are foreseeable but not yet specifically identified for individual borrowers,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,For this purpose gen- eral loan loss provisions are recognized in the amou nt of the expected loss for a period of twelve  months for loans that are not individually impaired  unless the credit default risk has increased sig- nificantly since initial recognition,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,In this case general loan loss provisions are recognized for loans  that are not individually impaired for the expected losses of the loans concerned over the remaining  term,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,The general loan loss provisions in  the customer lending business are highly significant for the net  assets and the financial performance  of the Company in terms of their amount and are also subject to considerable judgement on the part  of the legal representatives,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,In addition the valuation parameters applied which are also subject to  significant unce rtainties due to the effects of the war in the Ukraine have a significant influence on  the amount of any general loan loss provisions that may be required,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,As part of our audit we first assessed the design of the relevant internal control system of the Company  with reference to the recognition of general loan loss provisions,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,In particular we considered the pro- cesses for recording business data risk classifi cation of borrowers determination of general loan loss  provisions and validation of the valuation models,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,Furthermore in order to assess the general loan  loss provisions made we traced and assessed among other things the valuation models used by the               Company the underlying input data macroeconomic assumptions and parameters as well as the re- sults of the validation actions also with the involvement of our specialists in the field of financial  mathematics,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,The Companys disclosures on general loan loss provisions in the customer lending business and on  the management adjustment are included in the sections Accounting policies - non -trading portfolio  banking book and Impact of the COVID -19 pandemic and the Ukraine  war  of the notes to the finan- cial statements,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,Subsequent valuation of the guarantees agreed with th e State of Lower Saxony    As at 31 December 2022 there are two guarantee agreements between the Company and the State of  Lower Saxony under which the State assumes loss risks from a loan portfolio with ship financing and  aircraft financing respectively,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,The guarantee contracts are credit derivatives of the non -trading port- folio banking book for which the Company acts as secured party,CREDIT
Norddeutsche Bank,As pending transactions the guar- antee agreements will only be recognized in the balance sheet if a provision for conting ent losses  on- erous contracts has to be recognized due to negative fair values of the guarantees,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,The fair values of  the guarantee contracts as of 31 December 2022 are included in the disclosures on credit derivatives  in the section Derivatives not measu red at fair value in external relationships derivatives in the non - trading portfolio in the notes to the financial statements,CREDIT
Norddeutsche Bank,The fair value of the guarantee contracts is determined as the present  value of the guarantee commissions to be paid in the future and the expected future loss compensa- tion payments by the State of Lower Saxony w hich are estimated mainly on the basis of expected  losses from underlying loans,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,Loss -free valuation of interest -bearing transactions in the banking book    The business activities of credit institutions with interest -bearing financial instruments in the bank- ing book do not usually allow for a direct allocation of individual asset and liability -related interest - related financial instruments to each other as t he interest business of credit institutions is not usually  geared towards an individual refinancing of individual asset transactions,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,Consequently the interest components of the lendin g  transactions in the banking book are not to be valued in isolation applying the imparity principle but  in their entirety taking into account the refinancing,INTEREST
Norddeutsche Bank,If on the basis of the overall business in the bank- ing book the interest receivables  and in terest obligations still outstanding on the reporting date in- cluding risk and administrative costs result in an excess of liabilities this impending loss must be  taken into account by recognizing a provision,LOSS
Norddeutsche Bank,NORDLB has assessed whether there is an exc ess of  liabilities as at the balance sheet date in accordance with the accounting principles issued by the bank- ing committee IDW RS BFA 3 on the basis of a present value approach and has come to the conclusion  that there is no excess liability as at the ba lance sheet date,LIABILITY
Norddeutsche Bank,As a result of the sharp rise in interest rates in the 2022 fina ncial  year this issue was of particular importance in the context of our audit,INTEREST
Norddeutsche Bank,In assessing the Companys methodo- logical approach we evaluated among other things whether the allocation of interest -bearing finan- cial instruments in the banking book was carried out according to objective criteria a nd without arbi- trariness in accordance with the documented allocation,INTEREST
Norddeutsche Bank,We verified the fundamental assumptions of  the Company among other things with regard to the modelling of future cash flows for financial in- struments with indefinite interest or capit al commitments or with termination rights as well as with  regard to the determination of fictitious closing costs in the case of amount or maturity mismatches,INTEREST
Norddeutsche Bank,On the basis of our audit procedures we  were able to satisfy ourselves that the assumptions and determinations made by the Companys legal  represent atives are within what we consider to be reasonable ranges and that the methods and proce- dures used by the Company are on the whole suitable for determining any excess liability appropri- ately,LIABILITY
Norddeutsche Bank,The Companys disclosures on the loss -free valuation of int erest -bearing transactions in the banking  book are included in the section Loss -free valuation of interest -rate -based transactions in the banking  book interest book of the notes to the financial statements,LOSS
