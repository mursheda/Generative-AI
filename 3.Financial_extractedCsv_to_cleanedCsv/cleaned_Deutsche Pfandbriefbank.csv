Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,Given the weaknesses  of interbank rates used to date which became evident for the first time as part of the LIBOR  scandal legislators and regulatory authorities worldwide have been working on establishing a  system of transaction-based risk-free reference interest rates or to reform the determination of  reference interest rates,INTEREST
