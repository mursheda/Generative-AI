Banco Santander Bank,On the basis of  the respective current planning we decide together with the  shareholder to what extent there is a need for equity injections,EQUITY
Banco Santander Bank,The reason  for this is a very significant increase in commission and inte- rest expenses mainly due to increased capital market-induced  interest expenses from customer and non-customer business  as well as higher trader commissions paid due to the expansion  of business,INTEREST
