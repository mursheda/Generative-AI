ties, and from the reversal of loan loss provisions”, respectively",loss
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"Portfolio-based allowances and provisions in the lending business (general loan loss provision-
ing) are recognised for potential default risks in the lending business",loss
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"When determining 
amounts for general loan loss provisioning, pbb applies a model-based procedure using the 
regulatory risk parameters (probability of default – PD, loss given default – LGD) and contractu-
al information on loans and advances such as contractually agreed cash flows",loss
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"Regulatory risk 
parameters are transformed appropriately",regulatory
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"The transformation uses parameters that are based 
on historical loss experience",loss
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"Furthermore, the expected five-year swap rate for each currency is 
taken into account as an additional transformation parameter",swap
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,General loan loss provisioning is determined through probability weighting of various scenarios,loss
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"The baseline scenario used by pbb to determine general loan loss provisioning is weighted at 
55% (31 December 2021: 55%): the positive scenario has a weighting of 5% (31 December 
2021: 5%) and the negative scenario has a weighting of 40% (31 December 2021: 40%)",loss
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"For 
loan receivables which were subject to a significant increase in the risk of losses or default 
since the loan was granted, lifetime expected credit losses are recognised",loss
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"pbb has two Russia-related public investment financings with a gross carrying amount 
totalling €24 million in its portfolio, which are guaranteed by the Federal Republic of Germany to 
a very large extent",investment
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"However, the war between Russia and Ukraine and the subsequent reciprocal sanctions have 
macroeconomic consequences such as reduced economic growth, significantly increased infla-
tion, higher interest rates and supply chain issues, all of which could have an indirect impact on 
pbb's financings",interest
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"The market value forecasts used in the model to determine general loan loss provisioning for 
office financings are based primarily on external sources",loss
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"Moreover, the risk of a further rise in interest rates was taken into account in the 
negative scenario, as this may not be offset – or only to a limited extent – by future rent in-
creases, especially for office properties outside of prime locations",interest
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"This decision was based on the almost complete withdrawal of COVID-19-related social re-
strictions and hence the significantly lowered risk of credit defaults in connection with the pan-
demic",credit
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"In 2022, pbb made three changes as regards the calculation of general loan loss provisioning: 
Firstly: regulatory risk parameters, including the probability of default (PD) and the loss given 
default (LGD), are used as a basis for determining the amount of expected credit losses of of 
general loan loss provisioning",loss
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"The regulatory longer-term assessment over various economic 
cycles (through-the-cycle) that refers to a particular point in time is transferred into a reporting 
date-based or exact estimate of the current situation (point-in-time) as required under IFRS 9",regulatory
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"The expected five-year swap rate per currency is taken into account as a transformation pa-
rameter",swap
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"Based on portfolio-specific analyses, the five-year swap rate determined as at the 
average maturity dates of a portfolio is now used for calculations to specific dates",swap
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"Previously, 
the five-year swap rate was calculated based on a monthly average and without considering 
specific maturities",swap
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"The change in accounting estimates during the second quarter of 2022 benefited pbb’s net 
income from risk provisioning (write-downs and impairments to receivables and certain securi-
ties and additions of provisions in credit business) in the amount of €7 million and was almost 
completely attributable to impairments on balance sheet business",credit
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"The change in accounting estimates reflects findings from the ongoing 
project to revise regulatory approaches for determining risk parameters",regulatory
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"The change in accounting estimates during the fourth quarter of 2022 resulted in a reversal of 
impairments recognised in net income from risk provisioning (write-downs and impairments to 
receivables and certain securities and additions of provisions in credit business) in the amount 
of €55 million",credit
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"Thirdly: In determining the impairment and provisions, the maximum period over which ex-
pected credit losses are measured corresponds to the maximum contractual period over which 
the entity is exposed to credit risk",loss
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"In determining the period over which the entity is expected to 
be exposed to credit risk but where the expected credit losses would not be absorbed by the 
entity’s normal credit risk management activities, an entity is required to consider factors such 
as historical information and historical patterns",loss

assumes a higher probability of clients exercising their loan renewal options",loss

accounting estimates implemented during the fourth quarter of 2022 resulted in an increase of

nomic risk and regulatory credit risk (counterparty default risk)",credit

negative market values of derivative contracts included in one netting arrangement may be 
netted, and the future regulatory risk premiums for these products may be reduced",regulatory
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"As a result 
of the netting process, the credit risk is reduced to one single net receivable from one individual 
counterparty",credit
Deutsche Pfandbriefbank,"These risk-reducing methods are used for both regulatory reporting and internal measurement 
and monitoring of credit exposures – only when these are enforceable upon the relevant busi-
ness partner’s insolvency in the respective jurisdiction",credit

receivable/liability resulting from the netting process (receive or provide collateral)",liability
