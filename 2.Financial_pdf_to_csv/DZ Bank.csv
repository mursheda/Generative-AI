DZ Bank,"First-time application in 2023 of changes in IFRS  
The following new accounting standard and amendments to IFRS have been applied for the first tim e in 
DZ BANK’s interim consolidated financial statements for the first half of the 2023 financial year:  
– IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts  
– Amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts  
– Amendments to IAS  1 Presentation of Financial Statements  and IAS  8 Accounting Poli cies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors  
– Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction  (Amendments to IAS 12 
Income Taxes)  
 
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts  superseded the previous standard for accounting for insurance contracts (IFRS 4 
Insurance Contracts ) with effect from January 1, 2023 and is required to be applied to insurance contracts, 
reinsurance contracts, and investment contracts with discretionary participation features",investment
DZ Bank,"The main difference between IFRS 17 and IFRS 4 is the uniform application of accounting policies in are as such 
as revenue recognition, the measurement of liabilities, and the realization of gains at the start of the contract",revenue
DZ Bank,"Any existing line items on the balance sheet that would not 
exist had IFRS 17 alway s applied must be derecognized and any resulting net differences must be recognized 
in equity",equity
DZ Bank,"When applying the fair value approach, the entity determines the contractual service margi n (CSM) or loss 
component of the liability for remaining coverage at the transition date as the difference between the fair 
value of a GIC at that date and the fulfillment cash flows measured at that date",loss
DZ Bank,"For all non -life insurance business e xcept for casualty insurance with premium refund, the measurement 
model developed for the liability for remaining coverage is used in the premium allocation approach",liability
DZ Bank,"The measurement modifications here 
relate to the CSM, the loss component, and the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income and are 
largely based on information available pursuant to the German Regulation on the Reporting by Insurance 
Undertakings to the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BerVersV)",loss
DZ Bank,"For insurance contracts with direct participation features in personal insurance, the CSM and loss components 
are measured in accor dance with IFRS 17",loss
DZ Bank,"If this results in a los s 
component, the loss component is adjusted to nil and the liability for remaining coverage is increased by the 
same amount",loss
DZ Bank,"In addition, the CSM amounts that would have been 
recognized in profit or loss for services already provided under the insurance contracts are estimated by 
comparing the remaining coverage units at the transition date with the coverag e units in existence before the 
transition date",profit
