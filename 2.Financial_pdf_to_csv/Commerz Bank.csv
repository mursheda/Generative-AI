IDW Accounting Principle: Risk prov isioning for foreseeable, but not

Commerz Bank,"In this regard, the Bank makes use of the option provided pursu-
ant to the IDW Banking Committee Statement on Accounting [IDW RS BFA 7]: ""Risk provisioning for foreseeable, but not yet individual-
ly defined counterparty credit risks in the lending business of credit 
institutions (""general loan loss provisions"") to apply the methodolo-gy for determining the general loan loss provision using Stages 1 
and 2 pursuant to IFRS 9 also for the HGB financial statements",loss
Commerz Bank,"COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft applies a three-stage  
approach to measure risk provisioning, with an ECL model being 
used to calculate the expected credit losses (ECL)",loss
Commerz Bank,"Loan loss provi-
sions in Stage 1 correspond to the expected credit losses within the next twelve months",loss
Commerz Bank,"Loan loss provisions in Stage 2 relate to 
financial instruments whose credit risk has risen considerably since 
initial recognition, while loan loss provisions in Stage 3 are attributable to credit-impaired financial assets",loss
Commerz Bank,"Loan loss provisions 
in Stages 2 and 3 take into account all expected credit losses for the 
entire remaining term",loss
Commerz Bank,"Calculating loan loss provisions for expected credit losses in 
Stages 1 and 2 requires judgement and the use of complex models, 
inputs and assumptions",loss
Commerz Bank,"Loan loss provisioning is determined using the following inputs: probability of default (PD), loss given default 
(LGD) and exposure at default (EAD)",loss
Commerz Bank,"The model-based inputs used for calculating 
loan loss provisions do not yet fully reflect these effects",loss
Commerz Bank,"There is the risk for the financial statements that appropriate 
models or inputs are not used for the calculation of general loan 
loss provisions",loss
Commerz Bank,"We tested the design, setup and effectiveness of the relevant 
controls relevant for the determination of loan loss provisioning 
and performed additional substantive audit procedures",loss
Commerz Bank,"Among others, our audit included control testing procedures  
related to: 
 Calculation of the input-based loan loss provisioning 
 Derivation of top-leve l adjustments for the input-based loan loss 
provisioning and 
 Validation of the input-based loan loss provisioning models  
 We took account of the results of our control testing for the  
determination of the nature and scope of the other substantive au-
dit procedures",loss
Commerz Bank,"These included in particular:  Evaluation of the methods and accounting policies for determin-
ing loan loss provisions according to IDW RS BFA 7 
 Evaluation of validations of the Bank for selected significant 
models and recalculation of validation tests 
 Assessment of the appropriateness of the key assumptions for 
the allocation to the stage, ma croeconomic variables, scenarios 
and their weighting 
 Risk-based recalculation of loan loss provisions for Stage 1 and 
Stage 2 
 Review of the ratings and solvency for selected borrowers and 
assessment of the criteria used to identify a significant increase 
in the credit risk and 
 Comprehension of the input-based loan loss provision calcula-
tion, including the calculation methodology for top-level ad-
justments
