Figure 3: Components of Siemens Bank income
Net interest income at Siemens Bank arises from the spread 
between interest income on loans and investments on one 
side and funding-related interest expense on the other",investment
Siemens Bank 2021,"The net inter -
est margin contribution from the lending business generates 
most of the net interest income",interest
Siemens Bank 2021,"Liquidity-related invest-
ments in the deposit and treasury business normally gener -
ate lower interest margins",interest
Siemens Bank 2021,"As the portfolio in the core lend-
ing business grew moderately in the 2021 fiscal year after 
remaining almost constant in the previous year, the increase 
in net interest income reflects the increased average portfolio 
volume",interest
Siemens Bank 2021,"Nominal net interest income is also heavily depen-
dent on the volatility of exchange rates during the year, as 
a significant portion of the portfolio is denominated in USD, 
GBP and AUD",interest
Siemens Bank 2021,"Overall, Siemens Bank 
was able to continue to generate attractive risk-return pro-
files in the lending business, as, also against the background 
of a persistently low interest level in important core markets, 
new loan transactions were only entered into selectively, and 
the pursued business strategy was not purely volume-driven",interest
Siemens Bank 2021,"Since the portfolio in the lending business grew moderately 
in the 2021 fiscal year and net interest margins were suc-
cessfully kept largely stable, in spite of the high competitive 
pressure in the lending markets, the increase in net interest 
income is in line with Siemens Bank’s expectations",interest
Siemens Bank 2021,"The 
relative increase in general administrative expenses in the 
past fiscal year was slightly above the relative increase in net 
interest income and thus slightly above the Bank’s expec-
tations",interest
Siemens Bank 2021,"The increase is due in particular to higher person-
nel expenses, significantly increased regulatory costs and 
upfront expenses for the development of a new business 
field",regulatory
Siemens Bank 2021,"The impact of curren-
cy effects on the Bank’s profitability is in particular limited 
through the funding of loans in foreign currencies in the 
same currency",profit
Siemens Bank 2021,"Expenses for additions to allowances for losses on loans 
and advances declined in the 2021 fiscal year compared 
to the previous year and were thus lower than expected by 
Siemens Bank at the beginning of the fiscal year",loss
Siemens Bank 2021,"In contrast, additions to risk provisions for latent 
credit risk, which Siemens Bank had significantly increased 
in the previous year to take account of the uncertain mar -
ket environment, declined",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the structure of the lending portfolio – a high proportion of

Siemens Bank customers play a key role in the process for 
granting loans, assessing new business and determining the 
internal risk capital requirement",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"Siemens Bank has a num-
ber of rating procedures at its disposal for determining cus-
tomer credit ratings",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"Siemens Bank has defined ten rating classes to enable it to 
achieve a meaningful differentiation between credit ratings",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"This system therefore consists of a 
total of 19 different credit rating categories overall",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"The rat-
ing categories can be reconciled with external credit ratings 
using a conversion table",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"If credit ratings are available from 
an external provider in any particular instance, these external 
ratings can be used as an input for a credit rating procedure",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"All external credit ratings used by the Bank in its risk classi-
fication procedures are obtained exclusively from S&P, Fitch 
or Moody’s",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"Even if an external credit rating is used, Siemens  
Bank still carries out a credit rating analysis using its own 
knowledge and information",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"Credit rating classes 1 to 7 are 
used for unproblematic customers",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"If a borrower is classified with a credit rating of 8+ or worse, 
the borrower concerned is made subject to intensified obligor 
management",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"If a borrower is classified with a 
credit rating of 9 or worse, the borrower concerned is trans-
ferred to the problem obligor management unit",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"The credit rating 
for a borrower must always be considered in relation to the 
rating for the borrower’s country and is generally subject to 
an upper limit based on the country risk",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"A borrower’s credit rating is reviewed at least once a year on 
the basis of the latest available information",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"Credit ratings 
are reviewed immediately if there are changes in specific bor -
rower circumstances or significant changes in the economic 
environment",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"2 Portfolio management and modeling 
The lending portfolio is managed using an integrated 
approach comprising management of expected and unex-
pected losses, procedures for early detection of risk, stress-
testing procedures and a comprehensive assessment 
approach of new business",loss
Siemens Bank 2021,"Expected loss
To determine the expected loss, the Bank forecasts the aver -
age loss it expects based on the current credit rating and the 
current expected recovery rate for each and every borrower",loss
Siemens Bank 2021,"The expected loss is a key figure in portfolio analysis and a 
key input variable for pricing new business",loss

ing risk as part of the portfolio analysis, the expected loss is 
calculated for a period of one year; the maturity of the expo-
sure is used for the purpose of pricing new business",loss

A credit-value-at-risk approach is used to analyze lending 
portfolio risk and to determine the economic capital require-

pected loss and is a key risk variable in portfolio modeling",loss
Siemens Bank 2021,"Credit risk 
modeling at the portfolio level uses a simulation-based asset-
value model",credit

similar economic characteristics are aggregated into risk units

the lending portfolio is generated from the resulting changes 
in the probability of default",loss
Siemens Bank 2021,"In addition to the correlations of 
the risk units, another key input variable for the Monte Carlo 
simulation is the probability of a credit rating migration",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"To 
obtain this data, the Bank draws up a table based on histori-
cal credit rating migrations",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"The simu-
lated loss distribution takes into account not only losses due 
to a migration to a default class, but also economic losses by 
a risk unit caused as a result of the deterioration in credit rat-
ing",loss
Siemens Bank 2021,"The exposure for a risk unit comprises the loan amount 
paid out and any weighted amount related to open external 
credit lines",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"In addition to losses due to rating migration, the portfolio model also takes into consideration fluctuations 
of the recovery rate and asset recoveries",loss
Siemens Bank 2021,"While negative 
recovery fluctuations lead to higher loss in the event of rat-
ing migration, asset recovery fluctuations lead to direct loss 
in market value",loss
Siemens Bank 2021,"For customers with specific loan loss provi-
sions, the exposure is reduced by the value of the specific 
loan loss provision",loss
Siemens Bank 2021,"The credit value at risk and the risk contri-
butions for the risk units are then derived from the loss distri-
bution",loss
Siemens Bank 2021,"In addition to the credit value at risk, the risk con-
tributions from the largest portfolios and segments are also 
calculated in order to measure concentration risk",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"Country risk
Country risk is measured by analyzing concentration risk for 
individual countries in terms of economic capital require-
ment and credit exposure",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"Country risk is limited both by 
preventive action in which exposure limits must be adhered 
to during the course of the credit process and by the ongoing 
analysis of concentration risk in individual countries",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"Backtesting
Siemens Bank carries out monthly backtesting of the risk clas-
sification and probabilities of default as well as an analysis 
of rating migrations in order to ensure and refine the level 
of quality in its modeling of expected and unexpected loss 
(credit value at risk)",loss
Siemens Bank 2021,"Pricing
As part of the credit process, new business is assessed using 
measurement methods and pricing tools",credit

tools factor in funding costs, expected losses and tax effects 
as well as administrative expenses and the costs in connec-
tion with economic risk capital",loss

lished reporting and monitoring processes, ensuring that 
credit ratings are up to date",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"Qualitative and quantitative 
information is regularly monitored, classified and promptly 
included in any credit rating assessment",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"Stress testing
Lending-portfolio modeling and management using credit 
value at risk is complemented by targeted sensitivity analyses 
and stress tests",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"The stress tests and sensitivity analyses for 
credit risk are carried out regularly for the overall risk report-
ing as well as ad hoc",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"Stress tests, 
on the other hand, provide a holistic view for the purpos-
es of assessing credit risk",credit

The risk classification and the accompanying credit rating of 
the borrower form the basis for the credit decision and for 
the analysis of the expected and unexpected loss",loss
Siemens Bank 2021,"The bor -
rower’s credit rating itself is determined independently of any 
individual transactions and, as a result, also independently 
of available collateral",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"Types of collateral
In its management of credit risk, Siemens Bank makes a dis-
tinction between two fundamental categories of collateral:

guarantees furnished not by the borrower but by indepen-

Siemens Bank 2021,"Collateral management
Both categories of collateral form an integral part of credit 
risk management at Siemens Bank provided that such col-
lateral meets internal requirements for collateral that can be 
accepted by the Bank",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"Specifically, collateral in the second 
category is only acceptable if the credit rating of the guar -
antor is better than the rating of the original borrower, the 
guarantee is directly legally enforceable, all documentary 
requirements are met and the guarantor is not an individual",credit

expected and in the unexpected loss because the recovery 
rate for the transaction has been increased or because an 
asset recovery has been claimed",loss

risk, with the result that any general loan loss provision rec-

Funding risk is the risk that Siemens Bank will only be able

increased market interest rates",interest

Siemens Bank must then pay prepayment compensation

enter into credit risk and does not intend to compensate for 
the current margin pressure on the credit markets by assum-
ing excessive risks, the Bank believes that the continuing 
uncertainties regarding economic developments will result 
in allowances for losses on loans and advances remaining on 
the same level, or even slightly increasing, compared with 
previous years",loss
Siemens Bank 2021,"Overall, Siemens Bank expects a challenging 2022 fiscal year 
during which the increase in general administrative expens-
es and higher allocations to allowances for losses on loans 
and advances will not be able to be fully offset by business 
growth and higher net interest income",loss
Siemens Bank 2021,"In the short term, growth will be supported by catch-
up effects in private consumption as well as by the increase 
in equipment investment, which in turn will be promoted by 
economic policy measures, especially in the industrialized 
countries",investment
Siemens Bank 2021,"Renewed contact restrictions due to changed virus 
variants and increasing vaccine hesitancy may slow economic 
recovery down again",restrictions
Siemens Bank 2021,"On the basis of the forecasts quoted, Siemens Bank 
expects a scenario in which the global economy will recover 
steadily in the coming fiscal year, with industry-specific and 
regional differences and, possibly, repeated setbacks due to 
restrictions in individual countries",restrictions
Siemens Bank 2021,"Siemens Bank believes that the demand for project 
finance and investment loans will remain on a level that is 
similar to that of the previous years, as the planning cycles 
for infrastructure projects and project financing are usually 
longer",investment
Siemens Bank 2021,"Here, as in the 
past, the Bank intends to avoid exposure to excessive credit 
risk through a diversification by regions and industries, and 
through consistent risk management",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"In particular, the devel-
opment of virus variants with regionally low vaccination rates 
may lead to further outbreaks of the pandemic or renewed 
contact restrictions and may continue to severely affect the 
global economy",restrictions
Siemens Bank 2021,"Such a scenario 
would have significant impact on the growth and profitability 
of companies and may lead to credit defaults in the overall 
market, from which Siemens Bank would not be able to dis-
engage itself",profit
Siemens Bank 2021,"COVID-19-induced economic problems among borrow -
ers may have negative impact on allowances for losses on 
loans and advances and may lead to defaults in the lending 
portfolio",loss
Siemens Bank 2021,"In Europe, the conse-
quences of the UK’s exit from the EU, restrictions due to the 
disruption of supply chains and a rising trend in energy and 
electricity prices can be observed in particular",restrictions
Siemens Bank 2021,"While Siemens Bank limits political risks primarily 
through credit insurance, potential economic risks are man-
aged through strict credit risk management",credit
Siemens Bank 2021,"Siemens Bank 
believes that another risk factor lies in the persistently inten-
sive competition in many regional markets for project and 
investment financing that is due to the historically low inter -
est-rate level and associated high liquidity",investment
