Siemens Bank   Annual Report  2022 (translation of the German original)Financial position
The business activities of Siemens Bank are largely refinanced 
by deposits and equity",deposit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Here, 10% (previous year: 12%) of the 
recorded business volume of Siemens Bank is financed by 
equity",equity
Siemens Bank 2022,"Siemens AG as the sole shareholder of Siemens Bank 
has paid in a share capital of €5,000 thousand (previous year: 
€5,000 thousand) and capital provisions in the form of oth-
er payments into equity amounting to €995,000 thousand 
(previous year: €995,000 thousand)",equity
Siemens Bank 2022,"Although by far the largest proportion of deposits is made 
by Siemens AG and its subsidiaries, Siemens Bank also holds 
deposits of customers from outside the Group",deposit
Siemens Bank 2022,"However, 
Siemens Bank does not accept retail banking deposits",deposit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Where 
deposits are used directly for the purpose of funding the len-
ding business, they are matched as far as possible with the 
lending currencies, in accordance with the expected repay -
ment profiles so that the exposure of Siemens Bank to cur -
rency and maturity transformation risk is limited",deposit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Currently, Siemens Bank has not issued any bonds on capital 
markets, nor has it placed any promissory note loans or other 
bonds",bonds
Siemens Bank 2022,"Furthermore, Siemens Bank has not made any substantial 
capital investments or financial investments in the 2022  
fiscal year",investment
Siemens Bank 2022,"Results of operations
The 2022 fiscal year saw strong operational performance with 
an increase in the lending portfolio and higher interest mar -
gins, which is reflected in significantly improved net inter -
est income after the moderate growth of the previous year",interest
Siemens Bank 2022,"Nevertheless, additions to allowances for losses on loans and 
advances were significantly higher than in the previous year, 
due primarily to provisioning for an exposure in the European 
energy infrastructure sector that was adversely affected by 
the Ukraine conflict",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"As a result, Siemens Bank was not able to match the positive 
development of the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, but achieved 
by far the highest operating income before allowances for 
losses on loans and advances since the Bank’s formation,

Figure 3: Components of Siemens Bank income
Net interest income at Siemens Bank is derived from the 
spread between interest income on loans and investments 
on one side and funding-related interest expense on the 
other",investment
Siemens Bank 2022,Interest terms also reflect the effect of inflation,interest
Siemens Bank 2022,"The 
net interest margin contribution from the lending business 
generates most of the net interest income",interest
Siemens Bank 2022,"Liquidity-related 
investments in the deposit and treasury business normally 
generate lower interest margins",investment
Siemens Bank 2022,"As the portfolio in the core 
lending business grew strongly in the 2022 fiscal year after 
moderate growth in the previous year, the increase in net 
interest income reflects the increased average portfolio vol-
ume",interest
Siemens Bank 2022,"Nominal net interest income is also heavily dependent 
on the volatility of exchange rates during the year, as a signif-
icant portion of the portfolio is denominated in USD, GBP and 
AUD",interest
Siemens Bank 2022,"Since growth in the lending 
business portfolio in the 2022 fiscal year was stronger than 
in previous years and net interest margins were success-
fully increased, the increase in net interest income exceeds 
Siemens Bank’s expectations",interest
Siemens Bank 2022,"The relative increase in general admin-
istration expenses in the past fiscal year was below the rela-
tive increase in net interest income and thus in line with the 
Bank’s expectations",interest
Siemens Bank 2022,"As in the previous year, the increase 
is primarily due to higher personnel expenses, significant-
ly increased regulatory costs and upfront expenses for the 
development of EPT as a new business segment",regulatory
Siemens Bank 2022,"The impact of 
currency effects on the Bank’s profitability is limited, espe-
cially due to the funding of loans in foreign currencies in the 
same currency",profit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Expenses for additions to allowances for losses on loans 
and advances increased significantly in the 2022 fiscal year 
compared to the previous year and were thus higher than 
expected by Siemens Bank at the beginning of the fiscal year",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"In general, the structure 
of the lending portfolio – a high proportion of project financ-
ing in the infrastructure sector and of corporate lending 
transactions with equity sponsors from the private equity  
sector – predominantly proved to be resilient to credit 
defaults, also during the Ukraine crisis and against the back -
ground of increased macroeconomic uncertainties",equity
Siemens Bank 2022,"This effect dominates the item allowances 
for losses on loans and advances and is primarily responsible 
for the increase compared to previous years",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"Overall, the con-
tinued good credit quality of the receivables portfolio and the 
broad diversification by sector and region also contributed to 
the fact that the balance sheet allowances for losses on loans 
and advances for large parts of the lending portfolio contin-
ued to be very moderate overall in the 2022 fiscal year",loss

comprehensively involved in all aspects of decision-making 
processes relevant to risk policy",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Regarding further compliance-relevant internal 
provisions, such as regulatory questions or implementation 
of MaRisk, the central function is assisted by Risk Control-

Siemens Bank customers play a key role in the process for 
granting loans, assessing new business and determining the 
internal risk capital requirement",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Siemens Bank has a num-
ber of rating procedures at its disposal for determining cus-
tomer credit ratings",credit

ing categories can be reconciled with external credit ratings 
using a conversion table",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"If credit ratings are available from 
an external provider in any particular instance, these external 
ratings can be used as an input for a credit rating procedure",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"All external credit ratings used by the Bank in its risk classi-
fication procedures are obtained exclusively from S&P, Fitch 
or Moody’s",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Even if an external credit rating is used, Siemens  
Bank still carries out a credit rating analysis using its own 
knowledge and information",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Credit rating classes 1 to 7 are 
used for unproblematic customers",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"If a borrower is classified with a credit rating of 8+ or worse, 
the borrower concerned is made subject to intensified obligor 
management",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"If a borrower is classified with a 
credit rating of 9 or worse, the borrower concerned is trans-
ferred to the problem obligor management unit",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"The credit rating 
for a borrower must always be considered in relation to the 
rating for the borrower’s country and is generally subject to 
an upper limit based on the country risk",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"A borrower’s credit rating is reviewed at least once a year on 
the basis of the latest available information",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Credit ratings 
are reviewed immediately if there are changes in specific bor -
rower circumstances or significant changes in the economic 
environment",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"2 Portfolio management and modeling 
The lending portfolio is managed using an integrated 
approach comprising management of expected and unex-
pected losses, procedures for early detection of risk, stress-
testing procedures and a comprehensive assessment 
approach for new business",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"Expected loss
To determine the expected loss, the Bank forecasts the aver -
age loss it expects based on the current credit rating and the 
current expected recovery rate for each and every borrower",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"The expected loss is a key figure in portfolio analysis and a 
key input variable for pricing new business",loss

tion for the lending portfolio is generated from the result-
ing changes in the probability of default",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"In addition to the 
correlations of the risk units, another key input variable for 
the Monte Carlo simulation is the probability of a credit rat-
ing migration",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"To obtain this data, the Bank draws up a table 
based on historical credit rating migrations",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"The simulated loss distribution takes into account 
not only losses due to a migration to a default class, but also 
economic losses by a risk unit caused as a result of the deteri-
oration in credit rating",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"The exposure for a risk unit comprises 
the loan amount paid out and any weighted amount related 
to open external credit lines",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"In addition to losses due to rat-
ing migration, the portfolio model also takes into consider -
ation fluctuations of the recovery rate and asset recoveries",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"While negative recovery fluctuations lead to higher loss in the 
event of rating migration, asset recovery fluctuations lead to 
direct loss in market value",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"For customers with specific loan 
loss provisions, the exposure is reduced by the value of the 
specific loan loss provision",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"The credit value at risk and the 
risk contributions for the risk units are then derived from the 
loss distribution",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"In addition to the credit value at risk, the 
risk contributions from the largest portfolios and segments 
are also calculated in order to measure concentration risk",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Country risk
Country risk is measured by analyzing concentration risk for 
individual countries in terms of economic capital require-
ment and credit exposure",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Country risk is limited both by 
preventive action in which exposure limits must be adhered 
to during the course of the credit process and by the ongoing 
analysis of concentration risk in individual countries",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Backtesting
Siemens Bank carries out monthly backtesting of the risk clas-
sification and probabilities of default as well as an analysis 
of rating migrations in order to ensure and refine the level

rower’s credit rating itself is determined independently of any 
individual transactions and, as a result, also independently 
of available collateral",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Types of collateral
In its management of credit risk, Siemens Bank makes a  
distinction between two fundamental categories of collateral:
 »The first category comprises assets in the form of financial 
or other collateral that the Bank can realize in the event of 
a default, thereby allowing the Bank to limit the incurred 
loss",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"This category includes, in particular, physical assets in 
the case of capital investment loans or project finance as 
well as cash collateral",investment
Siemens Bank 2022,"»The second category comprises collateral in the form of 
guarantees furnished not by the borrower but by indepen-
dent third parties, for example government export credit 
insurance",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Collateral management
Both categories of collateral form an integral part of credit 
risk management at Siemens Bank, provided that such col-
lateral meets internal requirements for collateral that can be 
accepted by the Bank",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Specifically, collateral in the second 
category is only acceptable if the credit rating of the guar -
antor is better than the rating of the original borrower, the 
guarantee is directly legally enforceable, all documentary 
requirements are met and the guarantor is not an individual",credit
Siemens Bank 2022,"Collateral in the first category results in a reduction in the 
expected and in the unexpected loss because the recovery 
rate for the transaction has been increased or because an 
asset recovery is recognized",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"Collateral in the second catego-
ry also leads to a reduction in the expected and unexpected 
loss in that the credit rating of the guarantor is also factored 
into the calculation",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"These 
allowances are intended to cover the expected loss after tak -
ing into account any expected proceeds from the realized col-
lateral",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"Siemens Bank also recognizes general loan loss provi-
sions to cover the latent credit risk in the portfolio of loans 
and advances",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"In doing so, loan loss provision rates based on 
the rating, the expected term and the internal estimate of 
loss ratios in the event of loss are applied to the unsecured 
exposure",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"The rating also factors in an assessment of country 
risk, with the result that any general loan loss provision rec-
ognized by the Bank also covers the assumed latent country 
risk",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"As of September 30, 2022, Siemens Bank had total recog-
nized specific and general loan loss provisions of €161",loss
Siemens Bank 2022,"Specific loan loss provi-
sions include transaction-specific assessments of future cash 
flows, probabilities of default and expected loss rates, tak -
