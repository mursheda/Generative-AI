Kaiser Partner Privatbank achieves best result  
ever with systematic growth
Annual Report of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Management Board of Kaiser Partner Privatbank
In a very challenging market environment, Kaiser Part -
ner Privatbank was able to build on the successes of 
recent years and report its best result to date with an 
annual profit of CHF 5",profit
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"0 million (up 
24%) year-on-year improvement in profit was achieved 
through gross income of CHF 32",profit
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"3% of assets under management) and to further increase 
the profitability of the existing business",profit
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"On its growth path, the bank 
pays the utmost attention to the security of client assets: with a core 
capital ratio of 19",security
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"8%, the bank remains very well capitalized and is 
exposed to changes in the interest rate market only to a manageable 
extent, in particular due to its low risk appetite in the lending busi -
ness, which is limited to Lombard loans",interest
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"In order to make up for the shortfall of ever-decreasing 
Russian gas supplies and to fill up gas storage facilities, Europeans 
had to stock up on the world market during the summer at record 
prices of up to EUR 350 per megawatt hour",stock
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,", and in 
some cases considerably more, resulted in nothing less than the 
most aggressive, globally synchronized cycle of interest rate hikes 
in more than 40 years",interest
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"For example, the abrupt 
unwinding of years of zero and negative interest rate policies 
resulted in an unprecedented simultaneous sell-off in equities and 
bonds",interest
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"Even supposedly safe havens such as gold and real estate 
came under pressure in the face of the interest rate turnaround",interest
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"The resulting underperfor -
mance of green investment strategies was not the only reason for 
the first minor identity crisis of the fledgling sustainability industry",investment
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"In 2022, shares of 
substance were once again in demand on the stock market after a 
long time",stock
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"By contrast, companies whose sales and profits are not expected 
until well into the future had to pay tribute to the sharp rise in 
discount rates",profit
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"“What goes up, must come down” - in the price 
charts of many unprofitable technology companies and crypto in -
vestments, the rollercoaster ride of the past two years left behind 
various pyramid formations and sometimes spectacular bankrupt -
cies",profit
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"The fact that a lot of air has escaped from some investment 
bubbles in the meantime, that many investors’ dreams have burst, 
but also that a little more realism has returned, has its good side, 
just like the normalization of monetary policy",investment
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"And after a long time, 
government bonds are once again a valid investment alternative 
with an increasingly attractive risk/return ratio",investment
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"Financial result 2022
Positive development in profit and net new client assets
In a persistently challenging market environment with uncertain -
ties regarding the war and its impact on the global economy, 
increasing regulatory and margin pressure, the private bank gener -
ated a pleasing annual profit of CHF 5",profit
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"The main contributor was net interest income, which 
rose by CHF 1",interest
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"4 million, an increase of 44%, as 
a result of global developments in the interest rate environment",interest
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"Partner for External Asset Managers and Funds
As a custodian bank, our business clients, which include external as -
set managers and administrators of international investment funds, 
have their portfolios managed by Kaiser Partner Privatbank AG",investment
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"• Investments in people, knowledge, and systems 
guarantee more quality, safety and security, and 
efficiency",investment
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"Solid equity base
Mainly due to retained earnings, the equity base increased by 
6% to 59",equity
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"While savers were 
happy about the return of interest rates, consumers were worried 
about the declining purchasing power of their wallets",interest
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"However, setting the appropriate interest 
rate level is a science with multiple and ever-changing influencing 
factors and unknowns",interest
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"Moreover, the interest rate moves of the 
past few quarters have long and variable lags",interest
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"“Higher for longer” key interest 
rates, however, could belatedly lead to a recession after all",interest
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"In the equity mar -
kets, a textbook recession would most likely be associated with new 
lows and an extension of the bear market",equity
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"But even in the absence 
of a major economic slump, falling profits are likely to exert gravity 
on the prices of listed companies in the 2023 investment year",profit
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"Profit 
margins will remain under pressure, not least due to rising labor 
costs",profit
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"So the investment environment could remain challenging this 
year",investment
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"So far, quantitative tightening by central banks has only caused 
investor headaches in niches such as semi-liquid real estate funds",funds
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"However, temporary distortions and liquidity bottlenecks due to the 
sharp rise in interest rates cannot be completely ruled out in other 
investment segments in the near future",investment
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"And so the increasing alignment of economic, 
climate and security priorities with an eye on the world’s cli-
matic fever thermometer could also lead to a better outcome for 
people and the planet",security
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"In a few years, we may look back to the youth of 
ESG and live in an investment world of ESG 2",investment
Kaiser Partner Privatbank,"For example, we now also enable our customers to make 
dedicated “impact” investments in the private markets",investment
