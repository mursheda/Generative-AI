DEVELOPMENT OF THE BANK’S  
EARNINGS SITUATION
Our bank achieved an annual result of €444",profit
Banco Santander Bank,"The reason 
for this is a very significant increase in commission and inte-
rest expenses (mainly due to increased capital market-induced 
interest expenses from customer and non-customer business, 
as well as higher trader commissions paid due to the expansion 
of business)",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"015 billion, net interest income in the reporting year was 
2",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"We had already expected a significant 
increase in interest expenses, but in fact, at €–139",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"7 million, 
they are very clearly above our expectations, as the strong rise 
in market interest rates in the second half of the year first had 
an effect on the refinancing side",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"Another reason for the devia-
tion from the plan is the adjustment of the interest conditions 
for TLTRO utilisations",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"As the increase in interest income was 
smaller than the increase in interest expenses, net interest 
income decreased slightly overall",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"The ECB’s restrictive monetary policy caused market interest 
rates to rise, especially in the second half of 2022",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"As a result,  
we also increased the interest rates in new lending business in 
several steps",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"In the mobility sector, this resulted in the average 
interest rate increasing by 30 basis points compared to 2021",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"In 
Direct Business, the average customer interest rate in new busi-
ness was 57 basis points higher than in the previous year",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"In  
this portfolio, interest rate increases have no time lag",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"However, these higher interest rates in new business have a 
delayed effect on the portfolio",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"This stopped the decline in the 
average interest rate on our loans and advances to customers, so 
that this interest rate is at the previous year’s level of 4",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"In some portfolios, which are closely aligned 
with market interest rates, we were able to increase the aver-
age interest rate year-on-year again: This increased for dealer 
purchase financing by 73 basis points to 3",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"In the consumer loan portfolios, however, the average interest 
rate still declined slightly",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"Overall, interest income from the 
customer lending business grew by 4",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"A look at the shares that the individual product areas have in 
the total interest income from customer business shows a con-
tinued leading position of the mobility area",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"The contribution 
of the largest portfolio within loans and advances to customers 
was slightly below the previous year’s level at 51% of interest 
income",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"Direct business instalment loans (including credit 
cards and current accounts) continued to rank second",credit
Banco Santander Bank,"This means that it has just overtaken the mortgage 
lending business in terms of share; in this – still third-largest 
portfolio – the shares of interest income have continued to decline; this is due to the lower risk-related interest rate com-
pared to the other portfolios and the decrease of the portfolio",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"Interest income in the non-customer business increased signifi-
cantly by €45 million in 2022",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"In particular, interest income from 
bank loans increased by €34",interest
Banco Santander Bank,Income from deposits in the Bank grew by €16 million,deposit

the existing swaps",interest

Banco Santander Bank,"Customer interest rates grew in the 
course of the year due to the current interest rate development

Banco Santander Bank,"The largest effect on interest expenses in the reporting year 
was from non-customer business (interbank market and own 
refinancing activities): Here, expenses increased significantly 
by €109",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"From the utilisation of TLTROs, our bank generated negative 
interest expenses in open market transactions in 2022; this was 
due to unfavourably adjusted conditions for TLTRO utilisations",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"We also had benefited strongly from a premium in the form of 
an additional interest rate concession in 2021, as we had fulfil-
led the ECB’s lending criteria",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"Subsequently, the 
ECB also adjusted the interest rate for TLTRO drawings in the 
course of the change in interest rate policy",interest
Banco Santander Bank,"In the reporting year, 
the TLTRO adjustment had a profit-reducing effect of just under 
€22 million",profit
Banco Santander Bank,"Another reason for the increase in interest expenses in 
non-customer business were higher expenses for swaps by 
€29",interest

rate, so that the general interest rate development also had a

necessitated the formation of specific loan loss provisions 
in the previous year, the level of specific loan loss provisions

Risk strategy guidelines at  
Santander Consumer Bank AG
Responsibility for the management and control of all risks, 
including ESG risks, lies with the full Management Board of 
Santander Consumer Bank AG, in accordance with the bank’s 
business and risk strategy and within the framework of the 
competency regulations and organisational instructions",profit

the second approval of a back office function; this is based on 
competence regulations",credit

ness are generally controlled by an automated vote in accor-
dance with the specifications of risk management",credit

cular interest rate risks) as well as the management of liqui-
