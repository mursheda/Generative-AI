The Helaba business model
Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen Girozentrale ( Helaba ) is a credit 
institution organised under public law, with a commitment to 
operating sustainably; its long-term strategic business model

applicable provisions of the Charter and the Treaty of the For-
mation of a Joint Savings Banks Association Hesse-Thuringia",profit

As part of managing the Bank as a whole, Helaba  has integrated 
systems in place for business and profitability management 
which are firmly embedded in an overarching management 
framework",profit
Helaba Bank,"Profitability analyses and the results 
of cross-selling are also produced",profit
Helaba Bank,"Systematic prelim-
inary costings are carried out for loan agreements, in particular 
to ensure that new business is managed with a focus on risk and 
profitability",profit
Helaba Bank,"Profitability targets are managed on the basis of, for example, 
return on equity ( RoE ) as the economic return on equity (ratio 
of operating result before taxes to average capital employed in 
the financial year determined in accordance with IFRS )",profit
Helaba Bank,"For 
2022, the Helaba  Group set a target range of 6  % to 8  % for 
economic return on equity before taxes",equity

tion and write-downs to total profit/loss before taxes net of gen -
eral and administrative expenses including depreciation, amor -

Helaba Bank,"Capital adequacy is managed through the allocation of regula-
tory and economic limits and through the own funds ratios",funds

count the additional own funds requirements specified by the 
European Central Bank ( ECB )",funds

buffer requirements applicable at 31 December 2022, the min-

Evaluation Process ( SREP ) decision taken by the ECB  was

liquidity ratios are leading to increased liquidity management 
costs and therefore have a negative impact on profitability",profit
Helaba Bank,"As part of the implementation of the Single Resolution Mecha-
nism ( SRM ) in Europe, the competent resolution authority has 
specified an institution-specific minimum requirement for own 
funds and eligible liabilities ( MREL )",funds
Helaba Bank,"The mandatory final MREL  
for the Helaba  Regulatory Group, applicable from 1 January 
2024 (based on figures as at 31 December 2021), is 21",regulatory

competent resolution authority at the end of January 2023 and 
has been complying with the requirement since 1 January 2023",regulatory

WIBank",funds
Helaba Bank,"In order to fulfil its own aspiration to support the economy in 
the transformation, the Helaba  Regulatory Group has set itself 
strategic objectives across the three dimensions of sustainabil -
ity, environment, social and governance ( ESG ), and began back -
ing those objectives with key performance indicators ( KPIs) in 
2022",regulatory
Helaba Bank,"The KPI management system testifies to the Helaba  
Regulatory Group’s ambition to orient its business activities 
around sustainability and enables it to measure its progress in 
quantitative terms",regulatory

Key developments in the regulatory framework were as follows:
	■EU implementation of Basel IV  
In October 2021, the European Commission published its 
legislative proposals for the amendment of the EU Capital 
Requirements Regulation ( CRR  III) and Capital Requirements 
Directive ( CRD  VI), whereby the requirements of Basel IV 
(also known as the finalisation of Basel III) are to be imple-
mented in the EU",regulatory

Management Report Economic Report 
	■Review of the quality of own funds instruments 
The scope of the audit procedures conducted by the regula-
tory authorities as part of the Europe-wide supervisory review 
of the quality of banks’ own funds instruments includes the 
capital contributions of the Federal State of Hesse that form 
part of Helaba ’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital",funds
Helaba Bank,"Helaba  liaises 
very closely with its owners and has devised a number of dif-
ferent solutions that take account of the questions posed by 
the regulatory authorities",regulatory
Helaba Bank,"Helaba  and its owners are confi-
dent that at the end of the process, Helaba ’s own funds in-
struments will again be found to comply with all relevant 
regulatory requirements",funds
Helaba Bank,"This increase reflects strong 
demand for credit as a result of factors including customers in-
creasing stocks in response to supply chain problems, higher 
material / commodity and energy prices and greater funding 
requirements in connection with the sustainability transforma-
tion and infrastructure finance",stock
Helaba Bank,"Macroeconomic turmoil impacted heavily on the financial and 
capital markets in 2022, accounting for a large part of the year’s 
significant rise in inflation and sharp increase in interest rates 
over the entire yield curve",interest
Helaba Bank,"Central 
banks around the world brought the time of quantitative easing 
(QE) to an end as well as introducing sizeable interest hikes",interest
Helaba Bank,"Bank issuing activities in the capital market accordingly fluctu-
ated hugely in 2022 and were generally characterised by a 
sometimes quite significant widening of spreads, especially in 
the case of credit asset classes",credit
Helaba Bank,"Interest rates rose substantially 
too, considerably enhancing the appeal of the fixed income mar -
ket as a whole",interest
Helaba Bank,"Boosted by the substantial increase in interest rates, sales of 
retail issues placed through the Sparkasse network rose to a 
record volume of € 6",interest
Helaba Bank,"As in previous years, 
the customer deposits in the retail business within the Group, 
in particular through the subsidiary Frankfurter Sparkasse, 
brought further diversification to the funding base",deposit
Helaba Bank,"Once again the CET 1 ratio 
therefore remains well above the regulatory requirements",regulatory
Helaba Bank,"In its first credit risk sharing transaction, Helaba  freed up risk-
weighted assets ( RWA s) of around € 0",credit
Helaba Bank,"This credit risk sharing transaction synthetically transfers de -
fault risk to investors",credit
Helaba Bank,"The NPL  ratio for the Helaba  Regulatory Group (in accordance 
with EBA  risk indicator code AQT_3",regulatory
Helaba Bank,"In the Helaba  Regulatory Group’s MREL  portfolio, reg-
ulatory own funds accounted for 17",funds
Helaba Bank,"4 % regulatory own 
funds, 8",funds
Helaba Bank,"The MREL  portfolio is therefore well in excess of the current and 
future MREL  requirements specified for the Helaba  Regulatory 
Group by the competent resolution authority",regulatory
Helaba Bank,"Helaba  is guided by the final MREL  set by the regulatory author -
ities for the period from 1 January 2024, which stands at 
21",regulatory
Helaba Bank,"It is also successfully implementing its sustainable finance ad-
visory service, in which it offers a broadly based range of infor-
mation across sectors and products around the theme of sus-
tainable finance covering all financial instruments (loans, 
promissory notes, bonds, leases, guarantees, etc",bonds
Helaba Bank,"These transac-
tions included the issue of ESG -linked promissory notes in 
which the interest cost attaching to the promissory note is 
linked to the entity’s sustainability performance",interest
Helaba Bank,"Helaba  is pursuing a portfolio-based approach and is planning 
to issue more green bonds",bonds
Helaba Bank,"Externally induced costs (including ex -
penses for the bank levy, the reserve funds and assessments), 
in contrast, rose very significantly from 2018 on",funds
Helaba Bank,"The flexibility 
created by the project is facilitating investment in future growth",investment
Helaba Bank,"Over the last few years, it has therefore been able not 
only to consolidate its market position in its core areas of busi-
ness but also – on the basis of the good operating results 
achieved – service all subordinated liabilities, profit participa-
tion rights and silent participations in full at all times and pay 
regular dividends",profit

coupled with strong growth in net fee and commission income 
boosted the operating result before loss allowances to € 737 m

trative expenses",loss
Helaba Bank,"The expense under net additions to loss allowances / net 
remeasurement gains / losses was all but unchanged year on 
year, enabling Helaba  to increase its operating result before 
taxes by € 250 m to € 488 m",loss
Helaba Bank,"Net interest income, a key component of Helaba ’s income, rose 
from € 1,298 m to € 1,303 m despite a fall in contributions from 
participation in the ECB  tendering process ( TLTRO  III)",interest
Helaba Bank,"Net interest income also benefited from global 
interest rate rises",interest
Helaba Bank,"Conversely, lower 
income from early termination fees had a negative impact on 
net interest income",interest
Helaba Bank,"This was largely offset by the positive con-
tribution from investments of own funds due to the rise in inter -
est rate levels",investment
Helaba Bank,"Once again, the income of € 328 m (2021: € 82 m) resulted 
mainly from interest rate-related business, which is the focus of 
the customer-driven capital market activities",interest
Helaba Bank,"The very marked 
increase here reflects the significant changes seen in market 
conditions, especially interest rates",interest
Helaba Bank,"Due to the noticeable rise 
in interest rates and wider credit spreads, remeasurement gains 
on derivatives within net x-value adjustments ( XVA s) and a clear 
increase in customer demand for hedging instruments and cap -
ital market finance were the main drivers of the positive trend 
in net trading income",interest
Helaba Bank,"This very significant im-
provement is explained in part by lower expenses from interest 
on pension and other provisions and in part by the fact that the 
prior-year figure was adversely affected by additions to provi-
sions",interest
Helaba Bank,"Other administrative expenses were 
impacted by a very sharp increase in the European bank levy of 
€ 20 m to € 90 m and a very strong rise in expenses for the asso-
ciation overhead allocation and the reserve funds of € 35 m to 
€ 81 m",funds
Helaba Bank,"Whereas the European bank levy increased as a result of 
the general rise in contributions, expenses for the reserve funds 
went up due to DKB ’s switch to the private banks’ deposit guar-
antee scheme",deposit
Helaba Bank,"Depreciation and amortisation rose main due to 
increased investment in information technology ( IT)",investment
Helaba Bank,"The net operating income of € 1,811 m (2021: € 1,455 m) and 
general and administrative expenses (including write-downs) of 
€ 1,074 m (2021: € 966 m) combined to give an operating result 
before loss allowances of € 737 m (2021: € 489 m), which equates 
to a year-on-year increase of € 248 m",loss

Risk Classification
Risk types
The primary risk types for the purposes of containment in the 
Helaba  Regulatory Group result directly from its business activ -
ities",regulatory
Helaba Bank,"The structured risk inventory process, which is imple -
mented annually and, where necessary, in response to relevant 
developments, examines which risks have the potential to dam -
age the Helaba  Regulatory Group’s net assets (including capital 
resources), results of operations or liquidity position to a 
 material degree",regulatory
Helaba Bank,"The following primary risk types have been 
identified
	■The default risk or credit risk is defined as the potential eco-
nomic loss that can arise as a result of non-payment by or a 
deterioration in the creditworthiness of borrowers, issuers, 
counterparties or equity investments and as a result of re -
strictions on cross-border payment transactions or perfor -
mance (country risk)",loss
Helaba Bank,"■The potential economic loss is determined using internal 
or external credit assessments and risk parameters as -
sessed by Helaba  itself or set out in regulatory specifica-
tions",loss
Helaba Bank,"■The default risk does not include credit standing risks, 
which are mapped in the market risk under the residual 
risk and the incremental risk",credit
Helaba Bank,"■The equity risk – the potential economic loss as a result of 
non-payment by or a deterioration in the creditworthiness 
of an equity investment – that is not managed at the level 
of the individual risk types also forms part of the default 
risk",loss
Helaba Bank,"Such developments can lead to a decline in the value 
of the holding, to the reduction or cancellation of dividend 
payments, to loss transfers and to contribution, margin call 
and liability obligations",loss
Helaba Bank,"■The market risk is the potential economic loss as a result of 
disadvantageous movements in the market value of expo -
sures due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, share 
prices and commodity prices and their volatility",loss
Helaba Bank,"In this con-
text changes in interest rate levels in one market segment 
lead to general interest rate risks, specific interest rate 
changes (for example on the part of an issuer) lead to residual 
risks and changes in the price of securities subject to a credit 
rating as a result of rating changes (including default) lead to 
incremental risks",interest

obligations at Regulatory Group level ( IFRS )",regulatory
