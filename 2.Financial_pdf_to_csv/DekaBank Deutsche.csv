Strategic framework and responsibilities 
The credit risk strategy stipulates the parameters for all Deka Group transactions  that involve counterparty 
risk",credit
DekaBank Deutsche,"The credit risk strategy serves in particular as the foundation for the Group’s counterparty risk principles for loans as defined by section 19 (1) of the German Banking 
Act (KWG) and describes the business divisions and segments that are the focus of lending activities – including the specific risk determinants and minimum standards for new business",credit
DekaBank Deutsche,"Furthermore, the credit 
risk strategy serves to distinguish between the indi vidual risk segments and governs the handling of intra-
risk concentrations, cluster risks and exposures to sh adow banking entities under the EBA guidelines",credit
DekaBank Deutsche,"All 
lending decisions that deviate from the credit risk strate gy are classified as significant and must be reported 
in the credit risk report in accordance with MaRi sk",credit
DekaBank Deutsche,The credit risk strategy outlines the Deka Group’s risk cult ure,credit
DekaBank Deutsche,"For individual counterparties, risk is restricted using a limit system 
based on factors such as creditworthiness, collatera l, duration and country and sector considerations",credit
DekaBank Deutsche,"In addition, a blacklist is used in line with the credit risk strategy to avoid undesirable lending business that could involve reputational risks or an increased level of risk, or which does not meet the high sustainability requirements",credit
DekaBank Deutsche,"The responsibilities performed by the “back office” particularly include providing a second opinion independent of front office operations, ongoing management of exposures for certain financing, monitoring risks at 
borrower and portfolio level, acting as the administrati ve office for early risk identification, reporting, 
reviewing specific items of collateral and managing non-performing and troubled loans (including making 
decisions regarding loan-loss provisioning)",loss

Committee – may be necessary, depending on the amount and the rating limits",credit

through profit or loss",profit
DekaBank Deutsche,"The allocati on is quantified based on the Deka Group’s credit

days, with a probability of 99",loss

curves for credit derivatives, refere nce curves for various fixed-rate periods (tenor-specific), individual stocks,

income from changes in interest rates and the valuation result arising from changes in interest rates",interest

earnings at risk (EaR) approach, net interest income is simulated using various hypothetical shifts in the reference yield curve for each currency and compared to a reference scenario (using a reference yield curve

At stage 1, loss allowances are recognised in the am ount of the expected loss for the next twelve months, 
unless the risk of default has significantly increased",loss
DekaBank Deutsche,"Stage 2 is used to recognise loss allowances in the 
amount of the expected loss over the entire remaining life of the loan receivable if the risk of default has increased significantly",loss

risk provisions are recognised in profit or loss in the amount of the expected loss for the next twelve months",profit

and the lifetime expected credit loss is recognised in profit or loss",profit

where the credit rating has dropped by a specified amount relative to the initial rating on the first balance sheet date, or where the exposure has been classified as requiring intensive support",credit

of provisions for loan losses",loss
DekaBank Deutsche,"An irrecoverable receivable which has already been impaired is written off utilising 
the provision for loan losses",loss
DekaBank Deutsche,"If there is no specific valu ation allowance, the receivable is written off directly

DekaBank Deutsche,"Specific valuation allowances are recogn ised to take account of acute default risks if it is likely that not all 
contractually agreed payments of interest and principal can be made",interest
DekaBank Deutsche,"Specific valuation allowances are assumed in the following cases:

the debtor’s financial difficulties that the creditor would not otherwise consider
