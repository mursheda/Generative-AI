Counterparty risk management  
Management for limiting the counterparty risk is implemented as an integrated process at LBBW, and can be broken 
down into the three main componen ts of risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting as well as risk management:  
Integration of Berlin Hyp in counterparty risk  
Berlin Hyp has been integrated into all material aspects of counterparty risk management at LBBW since 1 July 2022",credit
Landesbank,"Berlin Hyp’ s risk is integrated into the calculation of economic capital at Group level, although counterparty risk (credit 
value at risk) is currently still determined on the basis of its own risk model",credit
Landesbank,"These procedures 
quantify the probability of  default (PD) of the individual investments",investment
Landesbank,"The rating grades are not only used for internal management purposes 
but also to measure the regulatory capital requirements",regulatory
Landesbank,"Loss given default (LGD) is estimated on the basi s of the valuation of 
the individual items of collateral",loss
Landesbank,"The add -on calculation takes account of the 
remaining maturity, product type and market factors (interest, currency etc",interest
Landesbank,"The capital charges for issuer risks held in the trading  book take account of the settlement payments 
and actual fair value losses as a result of default (jump -to-default method)",loss
Landesbank,"Expec ted losses, value adjustments and credit value adjustment  
The expected loss (EL) – as an indicator that depends on customer creditworthiness, an estimation of the loss at default 
and the expected exposure at default – provides the basis for the level of th e standard risk costs",loss
Landesbank,"The concept of 
expected loss is also used in the calculation of allowances for losses on loans and advance s under IFRS  9: For 
transactions in which creditworthiness has deteriorated significantly since conclusion, it is the EL over the entire residual  
term (stage  2), otherwise it is the EL for one year (stage  1)",loss
Landesbank,"In the case of a special situation (significant  macroeconomic 
turbulence), the EL is also recognized over the entire residual term (as for the 2022 annual financial statements) for 
stage 1 transactions in order to adequately account for the higher overall loss risk",loss
Landesbank,"In the case of specific loan loss 
provisions (SLLP), the present values of the expected cash flows (including proceeds from the liquidation of collateral) 
are calculated and allowances for losses on loans and advances are made on the basis of uniform standards applied 
throughout the Group",loss
Landesbank,"The market price of the counterparty risk of OTC derivatives accounted for at fair value is measured using the so -called 
credit value adjustment (CVA)",credit
Landesbank,"The credit 
ratings of the cou nterparty and of LBBW are taken into consideration",credit
Landesbank,"Credit value -at-risk 
Credit value -at-risk (CVaR) represents the unexpected loss of a portfolio above its expected loss",loss

that takes the defaults as well as rating migration into ac count is used to calculate this value",credit
Landesbank,Berlin Hyp has its own economic capital limit credit risk at Group leve l,credit

Landesbank,"Credit decisions are made in a system of graded competencies, which are 
regulated in the Bank’s decision -making system",credit

credit ratings as well as compliance on the basis of systems with the limits granted",credit
Landesbank,"A system is in place for the early detection of risks, comprising  procedural regulations and system generated signals, 
whose goal it is to detect any deterioration in credit ratings at an early stage",credit
Landesbank,"The early detection of any deterioration in credit ratings allows appropriate countermeasures, e",credit
Landesbank,"LBBW aims to minimize losses through 
generally successful restructuring activities, in line with the Bank’s own interests and those of its customers",loss
Landesbank,"Risk management  
Counterparty risks are managed, in particular, through the requirements of the credit risk strategy, through the economic 
capital allocation to sub -portfolios with the aid of the CVaR, and by avoiding and reducing concentration ris ks at the level 
of sectors, countries and individual counterparties",credit
