REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE MANAGEMENT 
REPORT  
Audit Opinions  
We have audited the annual financial statements of Norddeutsche Landesbank - Girozentrale -, Hannover, 
Braunschweig, Magdeburg, which comprise the  balance sheet as at 31 December 2022, and the statement of 
profit and loss for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2022 and notes to the financial state-
ments, including the presentation of the recognition and measurement policies",profit
Norddeutsche Bank,"In our vie w, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows : 
❶ Determination of specific loan loss allowances in the commercial customer lending business  
❷ Determination of general loan loss provisions in the customer lending business  
❸ Subsequent val uation of the guarantees agreed with the State of Lower Saxony  
❹ Loss -free valuation of interest -bearing transactions in the banking book  
Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:  
① Matter and issue  
② Audit approach and findings  
③ Reference to further information  
Hereinafter we present the key audit matters : 
❶ Determination of specific loan loss allowances in the commercial customer lending business  
① In the Company's annual financial statements, loans receiv ables amounting to € 66",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"As of the 
balance sheet date, there is a risk provision for losses on loans and advances in the form of specific 
loan lo ss allowances, among other things, which are largely determined by the commercial customer 
lending business",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"The measurement of the allowance for losses on loans and advances in the commer-
cial customer lending business is determined in particular by the st ructure and quality of the loan 
portfolios, macroeconomic factors, and the estimates of the legal representatives with regard to future 
cash flows, among other things against the background of the expected impact of the current macroe-
conomic conditions on the commercial customer lending business",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"The amount of specific loan loss 
allowances for commercial customer loans is the difference between the outstanding loan amount 
and the lower value to be attributed to it at the reporting date",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"The allowance for losses on loans and advances to commercial customers is measured on the basis of 
probability -weighted scenarios, which also take into account the impact of macroeconomic factors on 
cash flows",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"In addition, the amount of the allowances 
for impairment losses in the commercial customer lending business is highly significant for the net 
assets and the financial performance of the Company",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"In addition, we assessed the valuatio n of commercial customer loans, including the appropri-
ateness of estimated values, on the basis of samples of credit exposures",credit
Norddeutsche Bank,"Furthermore, in order to assess the spe-
cific loan loss allowances made, we evaluated the calculation models used by the Company and the 
underlying assu mptions and parameters",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"③ The Company's disclosures on the allowance for losses on loans and advances to customers are in-
cluded in the section “Accounting policies - non -trading portfolio (banking book)” of the notes to the 
financial statements  
❷ Determination of general loan loss provisions in the customer lending business  
① General loan loss provisions are recognized for counterparty risks in the customer lending business 
that are foreseeable but not yet specifically identified for individual borrowers",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"For this purpose, gen-
eral loan loss provisions are recognized in the amou nt of the expected loss for a period of twelve 
months for loans that are not individually impaired , unless the credit default risk has increased sig-
nificantly since initial recognition",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"In this case, general loan loss provisions are recognized for loans 
that are not individually impaired for the expected losses of the loans concerned over the remaining 
term",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"The general loan loss provisions in 
the customer lending business are highly significant for the net  assets and the financial performance 
of the Company in terms of their amount and are also subject to considerable judgement on the part 
of the legal representatives",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"In addition, the valuation parameters applied, which are also subject to 
significant unce rtainties due to the effects of the war in the Ukraine, have a significant influence on 
the amount of any general loan loss provisions that may be required",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"② As part of our audit, we first assessed the design of the relevant internal control system of the Company 
with reference to the recognition of general loan loss provisions",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"In particular, we considered the pro-
cesses for recording business data, risk classifi cation of borrowers, determination of general loan loss 
provisions and validation of the valuation models",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"Furthermore, in order to assess the general loan 
loss provisions made, we traced and assessed, among other things, the valuation models used by the 
 
    
  
  
Company, the underlying input data, macroeconomic assumptions and parameters, as well as the re-
sults of the validation actions, also with the involvement of our specialists in the field of financial 
mathematics",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"③ The Company's disclosures on general loan loss provisions in the customer lending business and on 
the management adjustment are included in the sections “Accounting policies - non -trading portfolio 
(banking book)” and “Impact of the COVID -19 pandemic and the Ukraine  war ” of the notes to the finan-
cial statements",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"❸ Subsequent valuation of the guarantees agreed with th e State of Lower Saxony  
① As at 31 December 2022, there are two guarantee agreements between the Company and the State of 
Lower Saxony under which the State assumes loss risks from a loan portfolio with ship financing and 
aircraft financing respectively",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"The guarantee contracts are credit derivatives of the non -trading port-
folio (banking book) for which the Company acts as secured party",credit
Norddeutsche Bank,"As pending transactions, the guar-
antee agreements will only be recognized in the balance sheet if a provision for conting ent losses ( on-
erous contracts) has to be recognized due to negative fair values of the guarantees",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"The fair values of 
the guarantee contracts as of 31 December 2022 are included in the disclosures on credit derivatives 
in the section “Derivatives not measu red at fair value in external relationships (derivatives in the non -
trading portfolio)” in the notes to the financial statements",credit
Norddeutsche Bank,"The fair value of the guarantee contracts is determined as the present 
value of the guarantee commissions to be paid in the future and the expected future loss compensa-
tion payments by the State of Lower Saxony, w hich are estimated mainly on the basis of expected 
losses from underlying loans",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"❹ Loss -free valuation of interest -bearing transactions in the banking book  
① The business activities of credit institutions with interest -bearing financial instruments in the bank-
ing book do not usually allow for a direct allocation of individual asset and liability -related interest -
related financial instruments to each other, as t he interest business of credit institutions is not usually 
geared towards an individual refinancing of individual asset transactions",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"Consequently, the interest components of the lendin g 
transactions in the banking book are not to be valued in isolation, applying the imparity principle, but 
in their entirety, taking into account the refinancing",interest
Norddeutsche Bank,"If, on the basis of the overall business in the bank-
ing book, the interest receivables  and in terest obligations still outstanding on the reporting date, in-
cluding risk and administrative costs, result in an excess of liabilities, this impending loss must be 
taken into account by recognizing a provision",loss
Norddeutsche Bank,"NORD/LB has assessed whether there is an exc ess of 
liabilities as at the balance sheet date in accordance with the accounting principles issued by the bank-
ing committee IDW RS BFA 3 on the basis of a present value approach and has come to the conclusion 
that there is no excess liability as at the ba lance sheet date",liability
Norddeutsche Bank,"As a result of the sharp rise in interest rates in the 2022 fina ncial 
year, this issue was of particular importance in the context of our audit ",interest
Norddeutsche Bank,"In assessing the Company's methodo-
logical approach, we evaluated, among other things, whether the allocation of interest -bearing finan-
cial instruments in the banking book was carried out according to objective criteria a nd without arbi-
trariness in accordance with the documented allocation",interest
Norddeutsche Bank,"We verified the fundamental assumptions of 
the Company, among other things, with regard to the modelling of future cash flows for financial in-
struments with indefinite interest or capit al commitments or with termination rights as well as with 
regard to the determination of fictitious closing costs in the case of amount or maturity mismatches",interest
Norddeutsche Bank,"On the basis of our audit procedures, we 
were able to satisfy ourselves that the assumptions and determinations made by the Company's legal 
represent atives are within what we consider to be reasonable ranges and that the methods and proce-
dures used by the Company are, on the whole, suitable for determining any excess liability appropri-
ately ",liability
Norddeutsche Bank,"③ The Company's disclosures on the loss -free valuation of int erest -bearing transactions in the banking 
book are included in the section “Loss -free valuation of interest -rate -based transactions in the banking 
book (interest book)” of the notes to the financial statements ",loss
