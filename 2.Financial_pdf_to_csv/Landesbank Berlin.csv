Audit opinions  
We have audited the annual financial statements of Landesbank Berlin AG, Berlin, comprising the 
balance sheet as of 31 December 2022, and the income statement, cash flow statement and 
statement of changes in equity for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2022, and the

policies",equity
Landesbank Berlin,"The current macroeconomic and geopolitical risks (Russia -Ukraine war, high inflation rates and energy

the financial performance of companies and private households, which also affects the assessment of 
deferred and, respectively, also acute risks",interest

according to the information in the notes, Landesbank Berlin AG uses the simplified method to 
determine  the global allowance (calculation of the expected loss over a period of twelve months

balancing of expected losses and creditworthiness premiums at the time of  granting the loan as well 
as over time have to be complied with as well",loss
Landesbank Berlin,"Accordingly, we have performed the 
following audit procedures in particular:  
As a first step, we obtained an  understanding of the development of the portfolios, the associated 
counterparty -related risks, and the processes for identifying, managing, monitoring, and assessing 
credit risks by inspecting evaluations and risk reports, conducting interviews, and revie wing guidelines, 
specialist concepts, and work instructions",credit
Landesbank Berlin,"Here, our focus was the assessment of the probabilities of default and loss rates derived 
from historical data",loss
Landesbank Berlin,"To the extent that the exp ected loss and the credit rating premium 
could no longer be assumed to be in equilibrium, we also assessed the calculation of a higher amount 
to be reflected, taking into account the contractually agreed remaining term and the credit rating 
premiums",loss
