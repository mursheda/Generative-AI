1) The allocation of earnings is based on the assumption that net interest payable on the AT1 bond is recognised on an accrual basis",interest
Aareal Bank,"Consolidated operating profit amounted to € 1 57 million in the first nine months of the 2022 financial 
year and was thus in line with expectations and significantly higher than in the previous year  
(€ 1 23 million) as a result of the strong operating performance and even though we recognised loss 
 allowance of € 1 26 million for our exposure to Russia, which is being run down",profit
Aareal Bank,"Net interest income of € 5 14 million was significantly higher than in the previous year (€ 435 million), 
mainly due to the expected year-on-year increase in the credit portfolio and first positive effects from 
higher market interest rates on the deposit-taking business",interest
Aareal Bank,Loss allowance totalled € 170 million (9m 2021: € 79 million),loss
Aareal Bank,"This includes an addition to loss allow -
ance of € 1 26 million for the Bank’s exposure to Russia which is currently being run down, bringing the 
coverage of the outstanding exposure (of around € 210 million) to approximately 60 %",loss
Aareal Bank,"Furthermore, we moved a new LGD model for our commercial property finance portfolio (which complies 
with new EBA guidelines for rating procedures) into production as at the end of the first half of the  
year; this new model also serves as a basis for model-based Stage 1 and 2 loss allowance",loss
Aareal Bank,"Net commission income increased to € 1 99 million (9m 2021: € 17 4 million) on the back of higher sales 
revenue at Aareon and the performance of the Banking & Digital Solutions segment",revenue
Aareal Bank,"Despite its transfor-
mation to a SaaS company, Aareon’s sales revenue increased to € 221 million (9m 2021: € 1 95 million)",revenue
Aareal Bank,"Net gain or loss from financial instruments (fvpl) and net gain or loss from hedge accounting in the 
 aggregate amount of € 1 6 million (9m 2021: € -1 1 million) was mainly incurred by positive valuation 
effects resulting from market developments for currency and interest rate hedging derivatives, due to  
the strong market dynamics and coming from negative values at the beginning of the year",loss
Aareal Bank,"The cost/income ratio in the banking 
business (which, in line with common practice in the banking sector, does not include the bank levy and 
contributions to the deposit guarantee scheme) improved to 39 % and demonstrates Aareal Bank’s high 
cost efficiency, even in a European comparison",deposit
Aareal Bank,"In the 
 previous year, it was burdened by € 1 1 million in interest on tax back payments, as well as lower rental 
income on properties held by the Bank, as a result of Covid-1 9",interest

Aareal Bank,The average deposit volume from the housing industry increased to € 1 3,deposit
Aareal Bank,"Given the strong operating performance during the first nine months of the year, Aareal Bank currently 
maintains its forecast for 2022 consolidated operating profit at the lower end of the range (€ 210 million 
to € 250 million; 2021: € 1 55 million) despite loss allowance of € 1 26 million for the exposure to Russia 
(currently being run down) and the impact of the ECB Governing Council’s decisions on the TL TRO pro-
gramme",profit
Aareal Bank,"Loss allowance (including credit risk-  
induced adjustments to the measurement of defaulted property loans, which are reported in net gain or 
loss from financial instruments (fvpl)) is projected to come out at the upper end of the range between 
€140 million and € 180 million (2021: € 1 69 million) due to the addition to loss allowance for the ex -
posure to Russia (currently being run down)",loss
Aareal Bank,"Net interest 
income is anticipated to continue its upwards trend as a result of the increase in the credit portfolio and 
positive effects from higher market interest rates on the deposit-taking business, thus ranging between  
€ 660 million and € 690 million (original range: € 600 million to € 630 million; 2021: € 597 million)",interest
Aareal Bank,"For the Banking & Digital Solutions segment, Aareal Bank assumes slight growth in net commission 
 income for the core activities and continues to expect an average deposit volume from the housing 
 industry of above € 1 2 billion (previously: around € 1 2 billion)",deposit
Aareal Bank,"Aareon is expected to see a marked increase in sales revenue in the region of € 305 million to  
€ 325 million for the current year (2021: € 269 million)",revenue
Aareal Bank,"With regard to capitalisation, Aareal Bank expects a CET1 ratio (Basel IV (phase-in)) markedly above 
1 6 % by the end of the year, despite the planned portfolio growth and subject to further regulatory changes",regulatory
Aareal Bank,"As a result of the unilateral amendment to the contractual terms, the Bank must realise a measure-
ment loss in a low to mid-double-digit million range in net interest income and net derecognition gain 
or loss, due to the interest rate hedges entered into in connection with TL TRO",loss

negative TL TRO implications, Aareal Bank is able to confirm the full-year operating profit forecast for 2022
