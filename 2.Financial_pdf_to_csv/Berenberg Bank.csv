fell again significantly by €  18",interest
Berenberg Bank,"The ratio of current net interest income (excluding income from 
participating interests/affiliated companies) to net commission income was 6  : 94

the Bank’s business model",interest
Berenberg Bank,"A key determinant of Berenberg’s net commission income is the securities and 
equities business in the Investment Bank business division",investment

Responsible Investment (UN PRI), we remain committed to our responsibility

the credit-financed stimulus of the previous year also contributed to this growth",credit

Strategies for integrating sustainability risks into investment deci-

We attach vital importance in our investment decisions to the topic of sustainability 
and the management of sustainability risks",investment
Berenberg Bank,"In accordance with regulatory provisions, we view sustainability risks as events 
or conditions in the areas of environment, society or corporate governance, the 
occurrence of which can have actual or potential material negative impacts on 
the value of an investment and consequently the financial position, cash flows 
and financial performance, and reputation, of a company",investment
Berenberg Bank,"Consideration of sustainability risks in our investment decision 
processes3) 
With regard to customer fund investments made by our Wealth and Asset Ma-

sustainability impacts as a strategic issue that is placed high on our list of priorities",investment

we are able to offer various ESG investment strategies that take ESG criteria into account to varying extents, thus enabling us to meet wide-ranging customer needs 
in the areas of equities, bonds and multi-asset products",investment
Berenberg Bank,"We use the analysis of ESG controversies by our external 
ESG data provider to identify companies that are implicated in particularly serious 
ESG controversies, and we exclude such companies from investments",investment
Berenberg Bank,"In the event 
of serious ESG controversies, we initiate an active dialogue with the company 
(»engagement«) for certain ESG investment strategies, regarding both existing 
holdings and new investments",investment
Berenberg Bank,"We 
then make a final investment decision based on our engagement and our analysis",investment

better take into account ESG risks and associated measures when making our

Berenberg Wealth and Asset Management ESG exclusion criteria",investment
Berenberg Bank,"We ensure that all securities in our investment advisory service universe comply 
with the Berenberg ESG exclusion criteria, and have included such criteria in 
our systems",investment
Berenberg Bank,"Our ESG exclusion criteria were introduced in 2019 and 
thus considerably in advance of regulatory requirements becoming applicable – in 
2021, the scope of application of these exclusion criteria was expanded significantly",regulatory

product range as part of our investment advisory services",investment

subscriptions to shares in sustainable investment funds",investment

to varying extents, thus enabling us to meet wide-ranging customer needs in the 
areas of shares, bonds and multi-asset products",investment

ESG factors – excluding or limiting certain activities, taking into account ESG risks and opportunities as part of an investment analysis and effecting change 
as an active investor through engagement and proxy voting activities",investment

tional stricter ESG exclusion criteria are applied to further limit investments in 
activities that do not, for example, facilitate any positive effects",investment

open to companies, issuers and project-related investments, such as green bonds, 
that have measurable positive impacts on society or the environment and help 
to address global challenges through products, services or financed projects",investment
