DekaBank Deutsche,In the United States the first significant central  bank interest rate hike came in early March 2022 whic h aimed to dampen domestic demand-driven inflation,INTEREST
DekaBank Deutsche,In line with its mone tary policy strategy the ECB initially  left key interest rates unchanged and concentrated on terminating its asset purchase programmes,INTEREST
DekaBank Deutsche,Th e remaining purchases under the Asset Purchase  Programme APP were modest in scale but sent an impo rtant signal that the ECB was explicitly ruling out key  interest rate hikes for as long as net bond purchases continued,INTEREST
DekaBank Deutsche,After lifting the deposit rate significantly into posit ive territory the ECB changed its approach to asset  purchases and longer-term refinancing operations,DEPOSIT
DekaBank Deutsche,With ef fect from November it recalibrated the conditions  of its long-term tenders TLTRO III as banks that ha d made considerable use of these funds would have  otherwise been largely shielded from the monetary poli cy tightening,FUNDS

DekaBank Deutsche,Moodys therefore also  currently sees no impact of ESG factors on the credit rating,CREDIT
DekaBank Deutsche,Even if  employees are only partially compensated for their loss  in purchasing power and a wage-price spiral is avoided  the passing-on of higher wage costs will likely permit  no more than a gradual decline in core inflation,LOSS
DekaBank Deutsche,In addition the ECB will begin in Ma rch to reduce its holdings under the Asset Purchase  Programme APP by not fully reinvesting the principal from maturing bonds,BONDS
DekaBank Deutsche,However the maturity profile  of the APP portfolio is a limiting factor as the ECB has so far ruled out selling bonds,BONDS
DekaBank Deutsche,This will be especially the  case for sovereign bonds from countries in the eurozone periphery,BONDS
DekaBank Deutsche,Like many analysts the credit rating agencies will then  review their forecasts and potentially adjust them dow nwards,CREDIT
DekaBank Deutsche,Businesses have more and more been unable to translate the still high nominal  revenue growth into corresponding profit growth  a trend that could continue or even worsen somewhat in the coming months,REVENUE
DekaBank Deutsche,Given the many negative factors affecting the globa l economic outlook stock market valuations at the  start of 2023 can be categorised as neutral,STOCK
