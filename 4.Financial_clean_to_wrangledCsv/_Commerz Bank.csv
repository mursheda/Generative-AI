Commerz Bank,At the same  time further investments will be made in digital applications and processes,INVESTMENT
Commerz Bank,The reason for this forecast is the expectation of largely unchanged equity indices particularly in  Germany,EQUITY
Commerz Bank,Overall we expect net income in the PSBC segment to be  significantly higher than in the previous year on the assumption  that the high one-time charges at  mBank in Poland resulting from  the credit holidays and from provisions for legal risks in connection with mortgage loans issued in foreign currencies will  not recur in the current year,CREDIT
Commerz Bank,As such the  operating return on equity should increase significantly and the cost-income ratio in the PSBC segment should fall,EQUITY
Commerz Bank,The operating return on equity should therefore remain stable with  slightly higher risk-weighted assets  while there is likely to be a  slight improvement in the cost-income ratio,EQUITY
Commerz Bank,Accordingly  Commerzbank is expecting a further increase in the net return on  tangible equity towards the target  of more than 7,EQUITY
Commerz Bank,Commerzbanks target for its Common Equity Tier 1 capital  ratio is based in part on the capital requirements resulting from  the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process SREP,EQUITY
